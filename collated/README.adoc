We use the tool https://github.com/se-edu/collate[Collate] developed by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU] team to collate
each contributor's code from multiple files.

== For Windows User

* Open your command line or PowerShell (or whatever your favorite terminal emulator)
* Make sure you are in this folder, otherwise change your directory by `cd collated\` etc.
* Run the `.bat` script file by the command `collate.bat`
* All collated codes will be generated automatically

== For Linux or Mac User

* Open your terminal
* Make sure you are in this folder, otherwise change your directory by `cd collated\` etc.
* Run the `.sh` script file by the command `sh collate.sh`
* All collated codes will be generated automatically
