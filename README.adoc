== Catering to Tourists visiting Singapore

This application strives to be the integrated platform where you can view all of Singapore's attractions and Michelin
starred restaurants without the need to juggle multiple tabs on your web browser.

[.underline]#What separates Tourist-Book from just using a web browser?#

* Optimized as a command-line interface (CLI)
**  Take advantage of various shortcut keys and commands so you type less.

* All the important details at your fingertips
** Emergency and useful contacts are just a key-press away `F2` or typing `sos`.
** Our data is formatted so the place's location, phone number and website is shown on one neat card.
** Places are tagged with other useful information like type of cuisine or if it is a place for sight-seeing.
** All the places can be filtered using `find` or `sort`.

* Plan your schedule for the day
**  `weather` and `psi` helps you decide if you should stay indoors.
**  `mrt`, the train map to help you plan your journey.
**  `goto`, shows you where the places are.
**  `dir`, for directions between places.
**  Loved a place? Use `bookmark` to make sure you never forget it.

* Helps you even when you're offline
**  `export` gives you a printable list to take with you.

*Many more features to come in V2.0, so what are you waiting for? Download Tourist-Book and type `help` to get started!*
