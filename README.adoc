* This is a desktop Resident Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* Resident Book is a newly conceptualised administrative tool catered for staffs handling hostel and college operations.
* Administrative staff often face difficulties in collating and gathering information from off-the-shelf software such as Excel, and may miss out important details using a large spreadsheet.
* Some common features include
** Events handling mechanism
** Tags to keep track of exchange/guests stays
** Temporary contacts for exchange/guests stays
** Import and backup of data for easier maintenance
** Typing and GUI available for efficient and effective operations
** Auto-complete to increase efficiency
** Calendar so you never lose track of the days
