* PocketBook is a Text-based contacts management applicationdeveloped by us. We are a team of NUS undergraduate students from different school and faculties.
* The application is targetted at students and working adults to keep track and to extract details of their contacts through their daily applications.
* This is a desktop PocketBook application. It has GUI but most of the user interactions are expected to be implemented using Command Line interface.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
