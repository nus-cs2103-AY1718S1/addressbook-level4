* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[level 4]:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list  panel and an in-built Browser.
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
