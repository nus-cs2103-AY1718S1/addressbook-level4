== Target Audience
---

* iungo is designed primarily for the young and the sleepless college students who have to juggle both their entertainment
 and work in their quest to secure better grades.

* College students' issues:
** You have meetings and interactions where you meet new contacts. Now that you have made friends and get along well, you might wish to save these interpersonal information on a single application solely built for the purpose of easy accessibility to their personal details!
** While using other methods to save these information is great (like your mobile phone), adding a massive amount of information
through the standard click and type method, may seem to be too slow and inefficient.
** Sleep deprivation are common among college student who opt for entertainment (e.g. making new friends, travelling) and
securing good grades.

* Solutions:
** iungo specifically targets these young adults who are more adept at using the keyboard, and prefers adding contacts solely
with the keyboard, rather than using a mouse. As a result, most of the available commands can be done using just a keyboard.
** iungo understands that college students often have to endure countless sleepless night and have specifically made
GUI themes that is suitable for both day and nighttime usage.

** iungo offers a quick way to save and look up webpages of a specific contact.
** It's the easiest application for remembering people.
** It's better than Address Book - Level 4.
