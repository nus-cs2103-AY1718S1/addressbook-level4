Looking way of keeping track of your contacts? Unsatisfied with ugly clunky designs currently available?

Look no further with the Gentleman's Guide. With a superb user interface and sleek, professional touch, Gentleman's Guide provides you with a contact book that even James Bond would love, shaken not stirred.

At the Heart of our Design is the idea that every man wants to be a Gentleman. Encompassing that idea is a system that respects you as you respect it. It provides the gentleman with exactly what he needed, when he needs it. Nothing more, nothing less
