* This is a desktop Resident Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* Immunity Book is a newly conceptualised contact book that is secure, efficient and handy for users with everchanging contact list.
* It is a Java sample application intended for CS2103 Software Engineering in AY2017/18 while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[level 3]:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list  panel and an in-built Browser.
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
