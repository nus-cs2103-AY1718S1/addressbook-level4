* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for a 20 year old socialite. The target user, X, can be described as follows:
** X is a 20 year old socialite and her life revolves around her friends and acquaintances. The size of her social circle is of great importance to her.
** X wishes to keep track of various statistics, such as the number of times she has accessed a particular addressbook entry, so that she can keep track of her social circle.
** Birthdays are highly important to X as her schedule will revolve around the various birthday celebrations of her friends.
** X shares a lot of secrets with her friends. She wants to be able to keep records of what she has said to each friend.
** X wants to be able to view the public social media information of her contact, especially the updates from her friends who are influencers.
