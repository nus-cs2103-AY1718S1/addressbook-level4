It's hard to be a teacher. We teach hundreds of students, take on extra administative roles and still have to monitor their grades.
And if they perform poorly, we have to manually contact their parents and find other ways to help them.

cherBook offers an easy one stop solution to all your problems. Our application helps you analyse and monitor your students' progress.
And if you ever need to contact their parents, their number is only a click away. Download our cherBook now for greater convenience.
