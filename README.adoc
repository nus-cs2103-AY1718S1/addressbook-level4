* This is a desktop address book application specially designed for debt collectors. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* Debt collectors have to make outbound telephone calls, take inbound telephone calls, and search for updated information on debtors daily. Thus, there is a need for a simple yet efficient way to handle all these information. This address book aims to address this need.
* Debt collectors can store information such as the amount owed, debt borrow date and debt cleared date in addition to debtor's personal information.
* Unique features:
** Automatic debt update based on interests
** Whitelist / Blacklist / Overdue list
** Export data in other formats
** Debt repayment progress bar and debt repayment status (overdue/completed/time left before payment deadline)
** Nearby persons panel (show contacts that live near a selected person)
