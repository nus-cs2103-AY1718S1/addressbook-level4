* It is a Java product application by team `CS2103AUG2017-W15-B4` in http://www.nus.edu.sg[NUS] module https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2103T[CS2103T]
* The base app, https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book (level 4)] is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
