* iContacts is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* iContacts is targeted to university students for managing contacts.
* Students meet many new people in the university, and it is important for them to build connections with other people, as connections may help them for their future career after graduation.
* As students meet more people, it will be difficult for them to remember all the information about the people they met.
* Therefore, iContacts aims to help students to store and manage contacts easily.
* In addition to managing contacts, students can also
** Find and filter contacts quickly.
** Add and manage reminders for upcoming events.
** Keep track of upcoming birthdays.
** Send e-mail to several contacts quickly.
** Locate the address of the contact's home using a map.
** Share contacts using the import and export command.
* iContacts is developed by a group of students as their project for the module CS2103T in NUS.
* This application was built upon the AddressBook-Level4 project povided by the https://github.com/se-edu/i[NUS SE-EDU initiative].
