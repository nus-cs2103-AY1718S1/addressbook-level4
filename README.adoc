* This is a relationship tracker based on a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions
happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is primarily targeted at *private investigators* who wish to find a way to maintain their ever-growing and ever-changing
information base easily.

== Why Intelli?

Wondering why you should use Intelli? +
Here are three extra-special features Intelli offers that may convince you why:

* Add named relationships between your contacts

Intelli enables you to easily keep track of who's who in vast and complicated social networks.

* Add and edit confidence estimates to relationships between contacts

Worried about getting the relationship between A and B wrong? Not quite sure
that A and B are indeed longstanding nemeses? As your relationship tracker, Intelli
will help to remind you of the uncertainty surrounding a particular relationship,
so that you can update it in the future when you gain more valuable information.

* Visualise detailed relationships in a graph

Sometimes, even the best private investigators can get entangled in the complex web
of relationships which they are investigating. However, with Intelli you can obtain a graphic
overview of these relationships, allowing you to see named relationships coupled with
confidence estimates so that you no longer have to fear keeping track of the messy networks
among your contacts.
