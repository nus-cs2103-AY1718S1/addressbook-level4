* This is a desktop address book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for students in order to facilitate contacts management and integrate it with the study-related information.
The target user is familiar with CLI and it is her preferred form of giving input.
