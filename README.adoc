user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

want to use it for:
** Storing clients information (contact, tags and special notes) and managing
relationship with clients better
** Scheduling and managing events (such as meeting with clients, call with
potential leads)
** Get timely reminders for upcoming scheduled events

timing through drag-and-drop interactions
