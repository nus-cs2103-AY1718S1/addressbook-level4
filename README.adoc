* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[level 4]:
** Quicker adding as only name and phone number are compulsory fields.
** Able to find person(s) with other details (phone numbers, emails, tags).
** Additional options for delete and google map on each person.
** Different themes for users to choose.
** Able to add additional details (birthday and remark) to a person.
** Supports sorting of persons.
** Auto generated persistent coloured tags.
** Able to import other XML addressbook.
** Can attach a photo to each person in addressbook.
** Person with 'important' (case-insensitive) tag will appear on top of list.
