* This application is intended for users who needs to keep track of many contacts.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*.

** The ability to store contacts online and retrieve them on any device.
** A better system to group the user's contacts with multiple Address Books, Groups and tags.
** More fluid and powerful CLI Commands.
** Export contacts to a file.
** Share Contacts to another user's Address Books.
