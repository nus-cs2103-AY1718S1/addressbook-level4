* This is a desktop Contact Book application. It has a GUI that allows user to interact with it to perform operations included in the Contact Book.
* It is a Java application intended for students in National University of Singapore, which means features of this Contact Book are tailored to the needs of the students.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes personal information panel.
** More test cases.
** A dynamic search bar for searching a person according to NAME, PHONE and TAG.
** More functions added:
*** DeteleByName Command which allows deleting a person from the Contact Book via his/her NAME.
*** Custom Command which allows updating of custom fields of a particular person from the Contact Book.
*** Update Phone Command which allows updating of additional phones of a particular person from the Contact Book.
*** Upload Photo Command which allows updating of the icon photo of a particular person from the Contact Book.

== Target Users
The target users are NUS students. They includes the local students as well as international students.
For international students, they might have multiple hand phone numbers.
For students, custom fields such as nickname, birthday might be required for some students but not all, therefore these custom fields might be required
to store the information of the students.
Students might like to have their own icon photos so that they are recognised their friends.
