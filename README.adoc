* PIMP is a desktop application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions utilise the Command Line Interface (CLI).
* PIMP is a Java application intended for a 20 year old socialite. Our target user, Kyleigh "Socialite" Jennar, can be described as a 20 year old socialite. Her life revolves around her friends and acquaintances. The size of her social circle is of great importance to her.

** To be able to keep track of various statistics, such as the number of times she has accessed a particular address book entry, so that she can keep track of her social circle.
** To be able to record certain remarks about her contacts and update information stored about her contacts
** To be able to view the public social media information of her contact, especially the updates from her friends who are influencers.
