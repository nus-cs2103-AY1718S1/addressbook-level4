* The Myth's Book is a desktop address book application dedicated for university students to store useful information such
 as the phone numbers and emails of the people around them. The Myth's Book is a `Command Line Input` based
 software which helps caters to students who are efficient and comfortable in typing out command line inputs to
 manipulate with information of their contacts in the address book.
* It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
