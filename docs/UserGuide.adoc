Contag is an efficient and feature-packed address book desktop application custom-built for PC, capable of organizing contacts for even the most demanding business users and busiest frequent travellers.

=== The ConTag Help System

Fret not, we are here to help you navigate the application with ease.

=== Features and Capabilities Overview
Key features you can expect:

* Saving comprehensive details of contacts in the address book to make each contact more meaningful

* Locating contact's address via the integrated Google Maps

* Creating a new schedule/activity with a contact

* Sending email to multiple contacts easily

* Find contacts by any attributes

=== Authors and Contributors
The initial version of the user guide was written by Team SE-EDU.

The current releases for ConTag are currently being orchestrated by a team of four:

 * Aw Wen Hao

 * Calvin Tantio

 * Cheng Jin Ting

 * Chung Tin Long

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John p/987654 e/john@e.com a/Blk 1, John St, #01-01, S407989` : +

* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

=== Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in *square brackets* are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be optionally used multiple times or not at all:

_e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc._

* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Command words can be replaced by their specified aliases e.g. `delete INDEX` is the same as `d INDEX`.


[TIP]
Once you have familiarized yourself with the application, try typing a command's alias in place of the full command keyword to save more time!
