== Introduction

=== Welcome to ConTag!

ConTag is an efficient and feature-packed address book desktop application, capable of organizing contacts for even the most demanding business users and busiest frequent travellers.

=== The ConTag Help System

Our help system is designed to progressively provide all necessary information to help you navigate the application with ease.

Apart from comprehensive help coverage in this user guide, you can also choose to get concentrated help on specific areas with `help` in the command line of Contag or pressing the `F1` key.

=== Features and Capabilities Overview
Key features you can expect:

* Saving comprehensive details of contacts in the address book to make each contact more meaningful

* Locating contact's address via the integrated Google Maps

* Creating a new schedule/activity with a contact

* Sending email to multiple contacts easily

* Find contacts by any attributes

=== Authors and Contributors
The initial version of the user guide was written by Team SE-EDU.

The current releases for ConTag are currently being orchestrated by a team of four:

 * Aw Wen Hao

 * Calvin Tantio

 * Cheng Jin Ting

 * Chung Tin Long

== Getting Started

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8 and below.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to your home folder of choice.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John p/987654 e/john@e.com a/Blk 1, John St, #01-01, S407989` : +
adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

=== Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in *square brackets* are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be optionally used multiple times or not at all:

_e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc._

* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Command words can be replaced by their specified aliases e.g. `delete INDEX` is the same as `d INDEX`.


[TIP]
Once you have familiarized yourself with the application, try typing a command's alias in place of the full command keyword to save more time!
