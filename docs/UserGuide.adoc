description of the application's system function, abilities and step-by-step procedures to be able to use Death Note
effectively.

== Getting Started

=== Introduction

Death Note allows you to store the name, profile picture, phone number, email, address, birthday and website of
your contacts. It also allows you to add tags and remarks to people stored inside.

Besides managing contacts, Death Note brings entertainment to you by having aliases for its commands and the amount
of entertainment it brings is only limited by your creativity.

=== Installation

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `DeathNote.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Death Note.
.  Double-click the file to start the program. You should see the graphical user interface (GUI) appear in a few seconds.

=== 30-Second Tutorial

Let's get started. Here is a quick demonstration showing how to perform basic contact management.

image::usage.gif[width="768"]

Here is an explanation of what is happening. First, add 3 persons namely Alice, Bob and Carol.

....
> add n/Alice
New person added: Alice Remarks:

> add n/Bob
New person added: Bob Remarks:

> add n/Carol
New person added: Carol Remarks:
....

Intuitive. Now you want to find the information about Bob.

....
> find n/Bob
1 persons listed!
....

To view everyone in your Death Note:

....
> list
Listed all persons
....

To remove the third person shown on the list from your Death Note:

....
> delete 3
....

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
