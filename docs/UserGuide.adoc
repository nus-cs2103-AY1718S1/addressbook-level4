== Hello CYNC user!
CYNC is an open-source, Command Line Interface (CLI) based software that
helps small businesses to track and nurture relationships with their customers.

If you're the owner of a small yoga studio, tuition centre, spa outlet, or even a dance studio,
then CYNC is for you!

=== How did you get your name CYNC?
Our name, 'CYNC', was derived from the word "Sync".
This represents our goal to keep customers and businesses in sync.

Also, the first 'C' in CYNC represents the customer.
This shows how much we value your customers and understand that it's a businesses' main priority.
Hence, we do everything in our ability to help you please your customers.

=== Why CLI?
We also know how much small businesses value their resources, hence we implemented CYNC as a
CLI-based software to allow you to manage your customers efficiently,
and focus on growing your business.

== Getting Started

Thank you for selecting CYNC as your preferred customer manager!
Here are some steps to get you started:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+

To download the latest Java version, click link:https://java.com/en/download/[here].

+
[WARNING]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `CYNC.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the `CYNC.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for CYNC.
[TIP]
It is recommended that you copy the `CYNC.jar` to your computer's Desktop for easy access.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The link:#GUI[Graphical User Interface (GUI)] should appear within seconds.

+

.  Type the command in the link:#UI[command box] and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts that have
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the link:#UI[Person List Panel]
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command. Before you do so, you may
wish to familiarise yourself with the layout of CYNC. This will help you to better understand the instructions for each
feature later on.

== UI Segments
We wanted to keep the UI of CYNC easy and simple to navigate. CYNC's UI is split into 5 main components,
as visualised below.

[#UI]

image::UiExplain.png[width="790"]
_Image 3.0.1: Main UI components, labelled_

// tag::commandprediction[]
=== Command Box
The `Command Box` is the main point of interaction with the app.
Users can input commands into CYNC via the `Comamnd Box`.

==== Navigating the `Command Box`

====
*Quick Usage*

* To enter a command, type a `command` into the `Command Box`, then press the kbd:[Enter] key to submit it
* Use the kbd:[Page Up] key to view previously entered commands, and the kbd:[Page Down] key to return to a more
recently entered command
* Use the kbd:[Up Arrow] key and kbd:[Down Arrow] key to navigate the
link:#commandPredictions[Command Predictions] (explained below),
folowed by the kbd:[Tab] key to select a prediction
====

[commandPredictions]

CYNC has a command prediction feature, which tries to predict the commands that you will type
before you even finish typing it. This allows the user to save time on typing and focus on
making their customers happy.

While entering a command, if a command prediction is available, it will appear as a list
below the input field, as shown in the image below.

image::command-prediction-1.png[width="790"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : The Command Prediction Panel_

Use the kbd:[up] and kbd:[down] arrow keys to navigate up or down the list.

image::command-prediction-2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Pressing the kbd:[down] arrow key will navigate to the next command prediction_

Use the kbd:[tab] key to select a prediction.
The input field will immediately be updated to contain the text prediction!

_Figure 3.1.3 : Pressing the kbd:[tab] button will select the highlighted command prediction_
//end::commandprediction[]

=== Result Display
The `Result Display` is the component which CYNC uses to let you know the app's status, such as whether

* A person has been successfully added to the AddressBook
* Your link:#sms[SMS] has been sent successfully
* An invalid command has been entered

Below is an example of the result display confirming if the user wants to send SMSes to the persons listed.

image::result-display-1.png[width="790"]
_Image 3.2.1: Illustration of the `Result Display` in action_

=== Person List Panel
The `Person List Panel` summarises the details of a customer and displays it in a logical manner.

To view more detailed information about the customer,
you can kbd:[click] on the customer's summarised details
which brings you to their link:#personInfo[profile page].

Below is a close-up of the `Person List Panel`

image::person-list-panel-1.png[width="790"]
_Image 3.3.1: Illustration of the 'Person List Panel` in action_

=== Main Display Panel
The `Main Display Panel` 's contents change according to the commands that are typed,
for example, typing the link:#sms[sms] command will bring up an interface which you can use to send SMSes.

Some of the commands which affect the `Main Display Panel` are

1. `sms`
2. `email`
3. `calendar`
4. `listalltags`
5. `select`

Below is an example of the `Main Display Panel` being replaced to show the sms interface.

image::sms-interface-1.png[width="790"]
_Image 3.4.1: Illustration of the 'Main Display Panel` showing the sms interface upon typing the `sms all` command_

=== Status Bar Footer
The `Status Bar Footer` displays important metadata about CYNC, such as

1. The date and time which CYNC's database was last updated
2. The total number of persons in CYNC's database
3. The address on your computer which your customers data is being stored

Below is a close-up screenshot to illustrate the different parts of the `Status Bar Footer`.

== Features

The features in CYNC are designed to assist businesses in storing their customers' information.
We understand that small business owners are often strapped for time, so we have kept the commands short and intuitive.

Feel free to jump to the relevant command that you think will be useful to you. If you have no idea where to start,
we recommend you to read the `add` command instruction as you will definitely need this command to get started.

=== Viewing help : `help`

If you need help with the usage of the software, type `help` in the command box to open up this guide +
Format: `help`

=== Adding a new customer: `add`

This is your most important feature of CYNC as it allows you to add a customer's information into Cync. +
Every customer will require a name[n/], email[e/], address[a/].

If you wish to group the customers together, you can use our tags[t/] feature.

CYNC would also auto generate a joined date based on the current day and assigned it to your new customer.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

=== Listing all people : `list`

If you wish to see a list of all customers stored in CYNC, you can use this feature +
Format: `list`

//tag::listalltags[]
=== Listing all tags : `listalltags`

You can use this feature when you've forgotten some of the tags that you've added or if you want to check for duplicate tags. +
Format: `listalltags`

Upon entering this command, you should see the list of tags shown beside the Person List.

This is illustrated by the diagram below.

image::ListAllTagsFeature.png[width="790"]
_Image 4.4.1: Illustration of the `listalltags` command_

//end::listalltags[]

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Your customer may have changed his/her details recently and you need to update them.
If so, you can edit an existing person in CYNC by using this feature. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

// What is "INDEX"? Where is it? What is an integer?
****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown beside a customer's name in your current window. The index *must be a positive whole number* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, we replace the existing tags with the updated ones.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

[NOTE]
 CYNC currently does not allow you to modify customers' joined date.

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
