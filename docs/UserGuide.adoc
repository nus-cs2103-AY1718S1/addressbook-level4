== Welcome to Unify
image::UG_mainheader_introduction.png[width="900"]
{sp}

=== Do More with Less
Unify is a Command Line Interface AddressBook that helps you manage your contacts efficiently. Unlike conventional Address Books, Unify adopts a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
By having a CLI, you can navigate and manage Unify efficiently by typing commands.
Commands capture the important details of your action into a concise line.
With just one line, you can traverse your large network to find your old pal John or update your Brother's phone number.
Now you can spend less time in your Address Book, and more time on what matters most to you.


=== First Time CLI User?
// tag::inline-hints[]
* Don't fret! Unify offers inline hints to prompt you what to type next,
+
image::UG_Hints.png[width="300"]
+
and will validate your input and display icons matching your command as you type. +
+
image::UG_Validation.png[width="300"]
// end::inline-hints[]

+
* Afraid you will accidentally delete your significant other's details? We've got you covered! The `undo` command lets you revert any important changes to prevent any future embarrassment/pain. +
* Still lost? You can type `help` to access the User Guide whenever you need. +
* Unify will guide you along the way so that you can turn from Novice to Master in no time! +

The subsequent sections of the user guide provides a step by step walk-through of all the commands Unify has to offer.

Do read our short explanation about Command Format and Tags below so that the subsequent portions of this section will make sense to you.

=== Command Format
====
image::UG_header_commandformat.png[width="500"]
{sp}+

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Tags

Tags are a way for you to label your contacts. Your contacts can contain multiple tags which help you identify them more easily.
A person's tag will be indicated on the List of Contacts as well as the Contact's details.

image::UG_tag.png[width="590"]

Tags should only contain letters and numbers, and cannot contain any spaces.

[TIP]
A common way to utilise tags is grouping your contacts with tags. For example, you can tag your family members with a `family` tag.
Next time if you want to search for your family members, you can execute the link:#find[`find` command] to list your family members.
