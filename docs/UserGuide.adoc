== Introduction

iContacts is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that helps you manage your contacts easily. You can use iContacts to add, edit and delete contacts. It has an easy-to-use search function to find specific contacts quickly. It also provides reminders for upcoming birthdays of contacts within the application and allows you to create your own reminders for upcoming events.
It is designed for university students to effectively manage their university life by using one single app through which they can manage reminders, details of contacts, email, and maps.

== Who should use our application

This application is targeted towards University students, aiming to meet their needs throughout their university life, and hopefully beyond. University students meet many people in the university, such as project group members, tutors, lecturers, friends and other connections. Nowadays it is important for students to build connections with other people, as connections may also help students for their future career after graduation. Since the students meet a lot of people, they may not be able to remember all the information about the people they met. Therefore, iContacts aims to help students to store and manage their contacts easily.
Not only that, a student can also keep in track of the deadlines through the reminders features. They will also be able to easily share their contacts with other people just by typing a simple command. Hence, through iContacts university students can make their university life easier to manage with all the various features.

* *Redo* : `redo`
* *Toggle* : `toggle`
* *Theme* : `theme THEME` +
e.g. `theme day`


== Coming in V2.0

=== Search Command +
Users will be able to search for persons fulfilling *all* keywords provided by the users. +
This allow a more focused and efficient search for users. +
Format: `search KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS]` +
`KEYWORD` is either `n/PHONE` or `t/TAG`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Both name and tags are searched.
* Only full words and tags will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`, `volleyball` will not match `vball`.
* Persons matching *all* the keywords will be returned.
****

Examples:

* `search n/Dickson t/volleyball` +
Returns all persons with name matching `Dickson` (case-insensitive) *and* tag matching `volleyball` (case-insensitive).
* `search t/friend t/NUS t/Computing` +
Returns all persons having tags `friend`, `NUS`, and `Computing` (all case-insensitive).

=== List Themes command +
Users will be able to switch to different color themes. They will be able to choose from a list of themes. +
This allows users to better customise their address book.

==== List Theme +
Format: `listTheme` +
A window will pop up displaying the list of available themes. Users need only take note of the theme name of the theme they are interested in for the next step.

=== Find by similar keywords +
Users would be able to obtain a list of contacts by entering similar keywords that is not identical. +
This is an enhancement to the existing `find` command, so format of command would remain the same. +

Examples:

* `find john` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe` and `Jon` +
* `find delylah justin`
One possible list of contacts returned might be `delilah`, `justinn` and `Justin Lim`.

=== Authentication +
Users would be required to provide authentication to access the application. This is so as to ensure the privacy of the contact information within the application. +
Users would be prompted to sign up when they use the application for the first time. +
To change the password, users need only type the command `reset`. Users would then be prompted for the new password.

=== Integration with online Cloud Storage services +
Users would be able to store and synchronize their contacts in the application within popular Cloud Storage services such as Google Drive. +
Users would be required to provide authentication for the Cloud Storage services of their choice, and then any changes to the contacts of the application
would be synchronized with the copy within the Cloud service. +
This way, users would have a backup copy of their contacts. Users would also be able to access their contacts from other devices, bringing about portability.


=== Enhance UI

The current User Interface (UI) doesn’t seem visually appealing to the user, which is why I plan to improve the design of the product. I aim to make it in the form of a chatbot where each command typed is a message sent by us and the result of command is the message sent by the product to us.
This will make the user feel more connected to the product as it adds a personal touch where user feels like he is interacting directly with a person. This enhancement will be perfectly suitable for the target audience which is the university students as they will be more comfortable using an application which works similar to a messaging platform.


=== Flexibility in Commands

Currently, iContacts is limited in terms of the command keyword that needs to be typed in for executing a command. For e.g. in order to view the location of a contact the `LOCATION` keyword needs to be used and using any other keyword instead of that will cause failure of the command.

To make the product more user friendly and provide more flexibility to the user, I aim to integrate the Natural Language Processing(NLP) library which will allow the successful execution of the command even when keywords similar to `LOCATION` are typed, for e.g. `MAP`, `DIRECTION`, `LOCATE`.
