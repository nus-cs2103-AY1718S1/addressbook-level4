== Introduction

Personal Information Manager Program (PIMP) is a command line interface (CLI) address book that allows you to store your contacts. You can use PIMP to add friends, add specific tags to them, add their social media accounts (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), or add remarks. You can search through the list of your contacts by typing specific names. For more advanced user, you can use regex to find your friends. Most of the functionality works by typing in single line commands.

PIMP v1.5 is available on any platform running Java 8.

== About

This user guide serves as an overview on using PIMP. This user guide also gives a reference of commands available within the application, as well as tips and examples on using it.

This user guide is simple and intuitive enough for anyone to understand. Gone are the days of you asking your techie friends what a certain technical jargon means.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `pimp.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PIMP.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`*: lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: adds a contact named `John Doe` to PIMP.
* **`delete`**`3`: deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`*: exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* The alias stated below refers to the command shortcut you can use instead of typing the full command. e.g. `e 1 n/Ben` instead of `edit 1 n/Ben`

Hence, `Joh?n` will match both `John` (with the `h` before the question mark), as well
