== Introduction

Introducing iConnect, our one-stop student networking application. We aim to serve as your personal secretary to ease your job as a student. Due to the ever-increasing workload, it has become a challenge to keep track of various school commitments while maintaining relationships with peers.

With iConnect, missing schedules and losing contact with friends will be a thing of the past.
Let’s get connected now!
