== Introduction
Are you having trouble keeping track of important dates and events? Is there too much hassle
in the current way you manage contacts? If these are problems that plague your everyday life, stress no further, for we've
engineered a cure!

DoC is here to remedy all your event tracking and contact management woes. Built as a Command Line Interface (CLI) application,
DoC provides a speedy solution to manage event and contact information, with only just a few clicks on the keyboard.

[TIP]
Command Line Interface (CLI): CLI is an interface that accepts commands in the form of typed input from the user's keyboard.

This user guide was written to guide you through the several features that DoC offers, and how you can use them.
For a quick summary of all the commands available to you, please refer to the following section: `5. Command Summary`.
