== Introduction

=== Welcome to Bluebird!

Bluebird is a desktop based organisational tool for the working parent on the go. Bluebird is suitable for a variety of
day-to-day management tasks, including managing appointments for both yourself and your child, and also organising the
contact information from your Address Book.

Bluebird has many capabilities to suit the different needs of the working parent. It assists in keeping the agendas of
your working life in order, and simultaneously manages the responsibilities in your personal life.

One of Bluebird's strength's is its ability to accomodate both the working parent and also provide a source of contact
storing and schedule management that is child-friendly but at the same time child-proof. The team at Bluebird put this
into action with the Parent Mode and Child Mode Protocol. With Bluebird, parents no longer have to worry about losing
valuable scheduling information while allowing their child to learn and explore technology.

=== Authors

BlueBird is created by the BlueBird Team of 4 members, namely Deepak Buddha, Alpheus Lim, Azizi Azfar and Wyn K Heng.

=== The Bluebird Help System

Before we get started, the Bluebird Team has provided you with the information necessary to understand how you can
quickly begin getting things into order with Bluebird through the detailed User Guide. We have also provided the
Developer's Guide, should you be interested to find out more about how the team at Bluebird made this product possible
from the backend view of a developer. However, if you are already in the application and in need of help,
you may easily receive guidance on-the-go by typing `help` into the command field, or by simply pressing the `F1` key.
Finally, to get a personalised user cheat-sheet, we have compressed the commands into the the command summary in
Section 5 below. Read on to begin your journey with Bluebird.

=== Features and Capabilities

As mentioned, Bluebird was made to accommodate both the working parent and also provide a source of contact storing and
management that is child-friendly but at the same time child-proof. This is put into action with the Parent Mode
Protocol and the Child Mode Protocol. The following list is a short overview of some of the features and capabilities
Bluebird offers you:

* Seamless contact information management including adding, removing, sorting and locating person(s), etc.

* Ease of updating your Address Book with undo and multiple delete functions

* User friendly interface that is also easy on the eyes with our signature Bluebird icon to guide the user

* Advanced parent safety controls with the 'Parent Mode' Protocol which disables certain commands that might be hazard
prone in the hands of the child

* Command history log that allows you to track what you have done should you need to refer or undo certain actions

* Load/Save feature that allows for smooth integration of your existing contact books

== Get to know Bluebird

In this section, we have provided a screenshot of what your screen would look like, and a quick guide to help you
navigate our user interface with ease.

== Features

By default, when Bluebird is launched, it will be set to Child Mode. This means that only certain commands
will be available. This ensures that your important contacts/tasks will not be modified by your child by accident.
To enable all commands, just type `parent` into the command box and execute it. +

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which
can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Prefixes in commands follow the first letter of each parameter to be supplied  e.g. `a/ADDRESS`, `e/EMAIL`, `b/BIRTHDAY`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]` `...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
acceptable.
