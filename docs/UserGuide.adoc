.Command box
image::command-box.png[width="790"]

// tag::command-syntax[]
=== Breaking down the command syntax
Commands have the following format: `[red]#COMMAND_WORD# [blue]#-OPTION# [green]#PARAMETERS#` +

* The [red]`COMMAND_WORD` is the first word in the command
** It specifies *what you want to do*

* [blue]`OPTIONS` come after the [red]`COMMAND_WORD`
** They are prefixed with a dash (e.g. `-tag`)
** Provides more information on *how the action is to be performed*

* [green]`PARAMETERS` are the last segment of the command
** They provide the *information required to execute the action*

Example:

* `[red]#find# [blue]#-tag# [green]#friends#` can be understood as "[red]#find contacts# [blue]#with the tag# [green]#friends#"

// end::command-syntax[]

=== Representing a person as a parameter

When using commands that involve managing contact information, you may be required to enter information about a person as a `[blue]#PARAMETER#`.

== Features

=== Understanding command formats
In this user guide, you will find information about how commands are to be used explained in the form of *command formats*.

[NOTE]
