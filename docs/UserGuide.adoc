== Introduction
Unable to keep track of all your deliveries?
Unsure which parcel is a more urgent delivery?
Did you ever wish there was a way you could easily plan your delivery route?
Now with Ark, you no longer need to worry about late deliveries and route planning.
Leave the heavy thinking to us and just deliver away! +

Ark is a delivery parcel manager with the ability to keep track of your delivery details.
These details include recipient's names, delivery due dates, locations, and tags.
Ark is also able to help you plan out your delivery route by using google maps
to help you get from one destination to another. +

== About

The user guide includes all of Arks functions and how to use them,
as well as providing you examples for easy reference. +

Ark assumes that you already have the postal codes of the delivery locations
of every parcel and bases its route planning base on postal codes only.

Ark can store the postal address of locations in Singapore. It only accepts values of `s` or `S` followed by 6 digits.
The postal code of a parcel is used to query Google Maps when the `select` command is executed.

[NOTE]
Presently, the `PostalCode` field still does a very relaxed validation and does not completely ensure that the postal
code exists even though it might meet the criteria above. The team is working on producing a database of postal codes
 in Singapore by quering the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. In the meantime, it is assumed that users will enter
 the correct postal code.

//end::postalCode[]

//tag::trackingNumber[]

[#tracking-number]
=== Tracking Number

Parcels have tracking numbers for delivery vendors to keep track of the parcels that they send out on a daily basis.
This feature is important because a single person can have many parcels belonging to him. Tracking numbers are used
to differentiate between the different parcels that are going to be delivered to the same person. Tracking numbers also
serve as a better way of narrowing down and pinpointing parcels of interest since these numbers are more unique

[NOTE]
Presently, the `Tracking Number` Field only has support for Registered Article tracking numbers belonging to SingPost.
You can read more about their Registered Article tracking number
 link:http://www.singpost.com/send-receive/sending-within-singapore/registered-article-local[here].

//end::trackingNumber[]

//tag::status[]

[#status]
=== Status field

`Status` is used to indicate the current stage of delivery that a parcel is at. It has 4 possible states:

* `PENDING` - This means that the parcel has not been delivered and has not passed the date it is supposed to be
delivered by. +
* `DELIVERING` - This means that the parcel is currently working being delivered to its destination address.
* `COMPLETED` - This indicates that the parcel has been successfully delivered to its destination.
* `OVERDUE` - This state indicates that the parcel has not been delivered and has passed its due date.

//end::status[]

[#tag]
=== Tags field

`Tag`s are used to indicate how the parcel should be handled. Tags can contain one or more of the following `Tag`s:

* `FROZEN` - This means the parcel should be refrigerated as its contents are temperature sensitive.
* `FLAMMABLE` - This means that the parcels' contents are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat.
* `HEAVY` - This indicates that the parcel is heavy and may require additional manpower to deliver.
* `FRAGILE` - This state indicates that the parcels' contents can be broken easily and
requires additional care when handling.

//end::status[]

//tag::browser[]
=== Google Maps Browser

Ark has an in-built Google Maps browser section in the main window and can be used to show you the locations
of the delivery addresses of each parcel. This feature will be automatically used whenever you type `select`
into the command box, and will display a Google Maps search of the postal code of the parcel's address in the
browser section of the main window.
//end::browser[]

//tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete

Ark comes with tab autocompletion which is able to complete a command for you
without requiring you to type out the command fully. +
To make use of this feature, simply key in the first few characters of the command you with to enter and press the
kbd:[Tab] key.
Ark will then fill in the rest of the command for you in the command box.
Then press kbd:[Enter] key to enter the command.

There is more than one possibility for the autocompletion, Ark will display the possible options to you as shown in the
below.

image::TabAutocompleteMultipleExample.PNG[width="400"]
_Figure 5.19.1 : If there are multiple autocomplete options, the options will be displayed in the result window_

Examples:

* `a` + kbd:[Tab] (auto-completes with `add` in the command line input)
//end::autocomplete[]

=== Saving the data

Ark data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

//tag::backup[]

=== Backing up the data

Ark data are backed up in the hard disk automatically at the start of every session of the program. +
There is no need to back up the data manually. +
The backup file is appended with `-backup.xml` and is stored in the same folder as the main storage file. +
The data from the backup file has to be loaded manually by copying the contents of the backup file into your main
 storage file. i.e. `./data/` folder

//end::backup[]

//tag::deliveryDate[]
=== Delivery Date Recognition

Ark can store the scheduled delivery date of parcels. It only accepts valid dates,
including valid leap years and days. +
Additionally, the dates should be in the following formal: DD-MM-YYYY +
The list of Parcels is kept in sorted order according to the delivery dates, with the earliest dates in front.

//end::deliveryDate[]

//tag::sortedList[]

=== Maintaining a Sorted List

The list of parcels stored in Ark is maintained to be sorted according to the delivery date of
the parcels, with the earliest delivery date at the top. This allows the more pertinent
deliveries to be shown quickly. +
The list is sorted whenever there is a change in the list that may potentially disrupt the order
of the list so that the user does not have to manually do so.

//end::sortedList[]

== FAQ

*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the
 data of your previous Address Book folder.
