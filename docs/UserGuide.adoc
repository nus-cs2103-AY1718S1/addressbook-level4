== Introduction

Rolodex is a desktop contact management application for people who have many social circles and wish to organise different groups of contacts separately and efficiently. +
If you are a businessmen with a long list of clients to keep in touch with, a teacher with the contact information of hundreds of students in your phone,
a freelancer with multiple groups of co-workers or customers, or just anyone with a need for fast and easy contact management, Rolodex is perfect for you.

== Quick Start

This section serves as a tutorial for you to familiarize yourself with the usage of Rolodex.
By following the steps below, getting started with Rolodex should be a fast and smooth process.

=== Installation

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
Rolodex will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `rolodex.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Rolodex.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. You should see the GUI (Graphical User Interface) in a few seconds as shown below.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]

=== User Interface

The following picture labels the main components of the application.

image::UiLabeled.png[width="790"]

The table below summarises the function of each component.

[width=100%, cols="1,3"]
|===

| Command Box | This is where you type in your commands to tell Rolodex to perform actions.
| Command Result Panel | After entering a command, the feedback/result will be displayed here. +
This is to notify you whether the command is valid, and to inform you if the action has been executed successfully.
| Contact List | All contacts are listed here in alphabetical order by default. +
When you perform a search action, the search result will be displayed here.
| Contact Detail Panel | When you select a contact in Contact List, his/her details (name, phone number, email, address, tags and remark) will be displayed here.
|===

=== Executing Commands

.  Type the command (case insensitive) in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to Rolodex.

[TIP]
The standard format for keying in person details is `PREFIX/PERSON_DETAIL` (e.g. `n/John Doe` for keying in a name). +
The following table summarizes the prefixes and the corresponding person details they represent. +

[width=30%, cols="2,3"]
|===
| Prefix | Person Detail

| n/ | Name
| p/ | Phone
| e/ | Email
| a/ | Address
| r/ | Remark
| t/ | Tag
|===

For the details of each command, you may refer to the link:#features[Features] section below.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

image::DropDownList1.png[width="300"]

The list will get updated as you type, to only display commands that match your input. Following the previous example,
if you type the letter "m" after having typed in "e", the list should only consist of the `email` command now.
