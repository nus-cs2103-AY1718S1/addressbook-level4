== Features

Before you continue with this section, do take note of the following:

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are *compulsory parameters* that requires your input.
** For example, if you see `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a compulsory parameter you have to include in the command.
** E.g.  `add n/John Doe`

* Words in `square brackets` [ ] are *optional parameters* that can be left unfilled by you.
** For example, if you see `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, `TAG` is an optional parameter you could choose whether or not to include.
** E.g. `n/John Doe t/friend`

* Words in `angle brackets` < > separated by a bar `|` requires you to fill up one of the parameters.
** For example, `< name | tag >` means to input either name or tag, but not both, in your command.

* Words with `…`​ after them are parameters that can be used *multiple times*.
** For example, `[t/TAG]...` can be left unfilled, but can also be inputted multiple times.
** E.g. `t/friend`
** E.g. `t/friend t/family t/brother`
