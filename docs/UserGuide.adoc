== Introduction
Unable to keep track of all your deliveries?
Unsure which parcel is a more urgent delivery?
Did you ever wish there was a way you could easily plan your delivery route?
Now with Ark, you no longer need to worry about late deliveries and route planning.
Leave the heavy thinking to us and just deliver away! +

Ark is a delivery parcel manager with the ability to keep track of your delivery details.
These details include recipient's names, delivery due dates, locations, and tags.
Ark is also able to help you plan out your delivery route by using google maps
to help you get from one destination to another. +

== About
This user guide gives you an overall view of the features of Ark and how to get started using Ark.
The user guide includes all of Arks functions and how to use them,
as well as providing you examples for easy reference. +

Ark assumes that you already have the postal codes of the delivery locations
of every parcel and bases its route planning base on postal codes only.

== Quick Start
