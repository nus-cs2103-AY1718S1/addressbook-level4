== Introduction
Unable to keep track of all your deliveries?
Unsure which parcel is a more urgent delivery?
Did you ever wish there was a way you could easily plan your delivery route?
Now with Ark, you no longer need to worry about late deliveries and route planning.
Leave the heavy thinking to us and just deliver away! +

Ark is a delivery parcel manager with the ability to keep track of your delivery details.
These details include recipient's names, delivery due dates, locations, and tags.
Ark is also able to help you plan out your delivery route by using google maps
to help you get from one destination to another. +

== About
This user guide gives you an overall view of the features of Ark and how to get started using Ark.
The user guide includes all of Arks functions and how to use them,
as well as providing you examples for easy reference. +

Ark assumes that you already have the postal codes of the delivery locations
of every parcel and bases its route planning base on postal codes only.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `ark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Ark application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all parcels and expands the parcel list section in the main window.
* **`clear`**` : clears the list of parcels.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd parcel shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Layout
What you see in the picture below is an example of what the main window
of the Ark application looks like. +

image::Ark_Main_Window.png[width="790"]

The main window is separated into 8 sections from the top to bottom:

. Red - Menu Bar
. Blue - Command Box
. Green - Results Box
. Yellow - Browser
. Purple - Divider (divides the Browser from the Parcel List)
. White - Parcel Card
. Orange - Parcel List
. Pink - Status Bar

The Browser and Parcel List sections sizes can be changed by commands
or by dragging the Divider part up or down to either increase or decrease either
section's sizes.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add #/TRACKING_NUMBER`,
 `TRACKING_NUMBER` is a parameter which can be used as `add #/RR000000000SG`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `#/TRACKING_NUMBER [t/TAG]` can be used as `#/RR000000000SG t/fragile` or as
 `#/RR000000000SG`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
 (i.e. 0 times), `t/fragile`, `t/keepDry t/frozen` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `#/TRACKING_NUMBER p/PHONE_NUMBER`,
 `p/PHONE_NUMBER #/TRACKING_NUMBER` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a parcel: `add`

Adds a parcel to Ark +
Format: `add #/TRACKING_ID n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] a/ADDRESS d/DELIVERYDATE [s/STATUS] [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A parcel can have any number of tags (including 0)
A parcel can only have one of four `STATUS` input. i.e. `PENDING`, `DELIVERING`, `COMPLETED` and `OVERDUE`.
If there is no `STATUS` input, it defaults to `PENDING`

Examples:

* `add #/RR000000000SG n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 S123121 d/01-01-2001

 t/fragile`

[NOTE]
Parcel Tracking numbers presently support only tracking numbers for registered articles managed by SingPost. These
numbers include two `R`s followed by nine digits and ending with `SG`. +
Support for other delivery companies will come in future patches.

[NOTE]
If not included in the add command, the default value of both the phone and email field is `NIL`.

tag::trackingNumber[]

=== Tracking Number Recognition

Parcels have tracking numbers for delivery vendors to keep track of the parcels that they send out on a daily basis.
This feature is important because a single person can have many parcels belonging to him. Tracking numbers are used
to differentiate between the different parcels that are going to be delivered to the same person. Tracking numbers also
serve as a better way of narrowing down and pinpointing parcels of interest since these numbers are more unique

[NOTE]
Presently, the `Tracking Number` Field only has support for Registered Article tracking numbers belonging to SingPost.
You can read more about their Registered Article tracking number
 link:http://www.singpost.com/send-receive/sending-within-singapore/registered-article-local[here].

end::trackingNumber[]

tag::postalCode[]

=== Postal Code Recognition

Ark can store the postal address of locations in Singapore. It only accepts values of `s` or `S` followed by 6 digits.
The postal code of a parcel is used to query Google Maps when the `select` command is executed.

[NOTE]
Presently, the `PostalCode` field still does a very relaxed validation and does not completely ensure that the postal
code exists even though it might meet the criteria above. The team is working on producing a database of postal codes
 in Singapore by quering the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. In the meantime, it is assumed that users will enter
 the correct postal code.

end::postalCode[]

tag::status[]

=== Status field

`Status` is used to indicate the current stage of delivery that a parcel is at. It has 4 possible states:

* `PENDING` - This means that the parcel has not been delivered and has not passed the date it is supposed to be
delivered by. +
* `DELIVERING` - This means that the parcel is currently working being delivered to its destination address.
* `COMPLETED` - This indicates that the parcel has been successfully delivered to its destination.
* `OVERDUE` - This state indicates that the parcel has not been delivered and has passed its due date.

These states have different colours codes to allow you to differentiate the `Status` values more easily.

end::status[]

=== Google Maps Browser

Ark has an in-built Google Maps browser section in the main window and can be used to show you the locations
of the delivery addresses of each parcel. This feature will be automatically used whenever you type `select`
into the command box, and will display a Google Maps search of the postal code of the parcel's address in the
browser section of the main window.

=== Autocomplete

Ark comes with tab autocompletion which is able to complete a command for you
without requiring you to type out the command fully. +
To make use of this feature, simply key in the first few characters of the command you with to enter and press the
 kbd:[Tab] key.
Ark will then fill in the rest of the command for you in the command box.
Then press kbd:[Enter] key to enter the command.

There is more than one possibility for the autocompletion, Ark will display the possible options to you as shown in the
 below.

image::TabAutocompleteMultipleExample.PNG[width="400"]

Examples:

* `a` + kbd:[Tab] (auto-completes with `add` in the command line input)

=== Saving the data

Ark data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

tag::backup[]

=== Backing up the data

Ark data are backed up in the hard disk automatically at the start of every session of the program. +
There is no need to back up the data manually. +
The backup file is appended with `-backup.xml` and is stored in the same folder as the main storage file. +
The data from the backup file has to be loaded manually by copying the contents of the backup file into your main
 storage file. i.e. `./data/` folder

end::backup[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the
 data of your previous Address Book folder.

== Command Summary

* *Add* `add #/TRACKING_NUMBER n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS d/DELIVERY_DATE [t/TAG]...` +
