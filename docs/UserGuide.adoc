== Introduction

As the name implies, link:{repoURL}[**BoNUS**] helps you _better(B) organize(o) your NUS life_.

* It is a desktop personal organizer application that targets at http://www.nus.edu.sg/[NUS] students.
* With *BoNUS*, managing _contacts_ and upcoming _events_ is no more a headache.
* It is oriented for typist user (most operations should be done using keyboard rather than mouse).
* Exclusive features have been developed to suit out primary user group - NUS students.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `bonus.jar` release from link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Create a folder you want to use as home folder for **BoNUS** and copy the `jar` you have downloaded there.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#commands[commands] section below for details of each command.

== Components

**BoNUS** mainly consists on three components: *contacts*, *events* and *calendar*. They work independently and each is
considered as a collection of one kind of `data items`. They are described in details as follows:

=== Contacts

You can store personal information of your contacts (friends, classmates, professors, etc.) in **BoNUS**.

* By default, you can store and update their name, phone number, email address and mailing address. Refer to the `add`
and `edit` command in the section below for more information.
* You can store other information of your contacts by adding customize properties. Refer to the `config add-property`
command in the section below for more information.
* You can group your contacts by adding one or multiple tags to them. Contacts with the same tag will be classified
under the same group. Tag can be displayed in the color specified by `config --set-tag-color` command.

=== Events

You can store your upcoming events (meeting with professor tomorrow, assignment deadline, lecture/tutorial time slot, etc.) in **BoNUS**.

* By default, you can store and update their title, interval (starting time and end time), venue and description. Refer
to the `addE` and `editE` command in the section below for more information.
* Similar to link:#contacts[contacts], you can add customize properties to events as well.
* Similar to link:#contacts[contacts], you can add tags to events as well.
* If you have set starting and/or end time for an event, it will be reflected accordingly on the link:#calendar[calendar] component.
* You can set notification at specific time before an event starts (when you should arrive at the venue before a meeting
begins) or at specific time before an event ends (when you need to finalize your assignment and submit it to your professor).
* You can link one or more link:#contacts[contacts] to an event (if they are going to attend the event together with you).

=== Calendar

_(Coming in v2.0)_

Calender provides a more convenient interface for you to view your upcoming link:#events[events]. All events are displayed
based on their time interval. Events whose time intervals are not specified will not be displayed here.

* You can choose the style to display the upcoming events (weekly/monthly/yearly view).
* You can add/update/delete events here, but the actual operation will be handled by the link:#events[events] component.

== Key features

=== Convenient

**BoNUS** can provide ultimate convenience and save much time in your daily life.

* Import contacts from _iCloud_, _Google+_, _Facebook_, etc.
* Import events from _Google_ _Calendar_, _Outlook_ _Calendar_, etc.
* Export data (contacts and events) to `.xml` file (default storage format for **BoNUS**), Excel Worksheet, etc.
* Sync between all your devices.
* (**Exclusive**) automatically generate your school schedule by simply entering your timetable URL from _https://nusmods.com/[NUSMods]_.

=== Fast

As long as the number of records stored is less than 50,000 and the size of the storage file is smaller than 20MB, **BoNUS**
is expected to

* Start the application in 5 seconds.
* Return the result of all link:#commands[commands] available with _human-invisible_ delay.
* Update things displayed on the GUI (graphic user interface) smoothly.

=== Secured

The **BoNUS** developers understand our users will store personal data in the application. We value privacy and security
a lot.

* All data saved to the storage file will be encrypted using the state-of-the-art encryption scheme (AES-256).
* You will be prompted to enter their password whenever they open the application (if you has decided to lock your application
the last time before you exited).
* You can set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) to fulfill extra security requirement(s).

== Commands

The listing below shows a summary of all commands currently available to users and how to use them.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in parentheses represent the command shortcut e.g. in `(a)add n/NAME`, `a` is the shorthand-equivalent notation for the `add` command.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which
can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be typed in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`
is also acceptable.
====

====
*Command in different components*

* Most command can be applied to either a person or an event, whose result will depend on the context e.g. `add` will add
a person if the user is currently in the link:#contacts[contacts] component, otherwise `addE` will add a new link:#events[event].
* All commands entered in the link:#calendar[calendar] component will actually be handled by either link:#contacts[contacts]
component or link:#events[events] component.
====

=== Viewing help : `(h)help`

Format: `(h)help` (or press `F1` on the keyboard)

=== Adding a person : `(a)add`

Adds a person to the application. +
Format: `(a)add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
In a similar format, you can also add customize properties when adding a new person, as long as you have used `config
--add-property` command to define that property before.

Example:

First, add a birthday property with the short name `b`

* `config --add-property s/b f/birthday`

Then, you can set the value of `birthday` property when you add a new person (_see `b/12091191` below_)

=== Editing a person : `(e)edit`

Edits an existing person in the application. +
Format: `(e)edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last listing.
The index *must be a positive integer* like 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values of the selected data item will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of that data item will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all existing tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The search can be based on one or multiple properties. The short name of the property `n/` can be omitted if the searching
criteria is for the `name` property.
* Apply `OR` search for keywords of the same property, i.e. persons/events matching at least one keyword will be returned.
e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`. Thus, the order of the keywords for the same property does not matter.
 e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Apply `AND` search for keywords of the different property, i.e. only persons/events matching all of the required properties
will be returned. e.g. `Hans Bo p/84651943` will only return persons whose name contains either `Hans` or `Bo`, as well as,
whose phone number is the same as `84651943`.

Imports the data in an external XML file, including data from all three components: *Contacts*, *Events* and *Calendar*,
into the current address book of *BoNUS*. +
Format: `(i)import FILEPATH`

[NOTE]
====
The default data format is `.xml` file. Without explicit parameters, the application will treat the given path as a file
in `.xml` format. It is unnecessary to explicitly state `import --xml FILEPATH`, although you are allowed to do so.
====

==== From NUSMods URL

_(Exclusive feature for NUS students)_

The **BoNUS** team understands that https://nusmods.com/[NUSMods] has become an indispensable school timetable builder
for almost all students at NUS. Thus, you are definitely allowed to import your timetable from NUSMods to the *BoNUS*
application. +
Format: `(i)import --nusmods YOUR_NUSMODS_URL`

****
* The URL provided must be complete and should begin with `http(s)://nusmods.com/timetable/`.
* Directly copy from the address bar of your browser. Do *NOT* use the short URL generated by the _Sharing Timetable_ feature
provided by NUSMods.
* Final examinations for all modules in your NUSMods timetable will be automatically added as events to the application.
****

Example:

* `import --nusmods +++https://nusmods.com/timetable/2017-2018/sem1?CS2103T[TUT]=C01+++`

=== Exporting data : `(p)export`

==== To `.xml` format

Exports the current data in the application, including data from all three components: *Contacts*, *Events* and
*Calendar*, to an external location. +
Format: `(p)export FILEPATH`

****
* Exports data to the location and file name specified by `FILEPATH`.
* `FILEPATH` must end with an extension of `.xml`.
* The file name and any non-existent folder names in `FILEPATH` should not contain any prohibited characters `?!%*+:|"<>`.
* If a relative path is provided, the data will be exported to a location relative to the *BoNUS* installation directory.
* Existing data file at `FILEPATH` will be overwritten.
* Parent directories, if specified in `FILEPATH`, will be created if they do not exist.
****

Examples:

* For `Windows` users: +

=== Advance setting : `(cfg)config`

Changes the configuration of the application or applies some advance settings to the data. Make sure you know what you
are doing before using any of the following commands. These commands are intended for advance users.

==== Add new property : `(cfg)config --add-property`

Adds a new property field available to all persons or events. +
Format: `(cfg)config --add-property s/SHORT_NAME f/FULL_NAME [m/MESSAGE r/REGULAR_EXPRESSION]`

****
* This command does not add a new property to a specific person. Instead, it defines a property that will be available to
all persons/events.
* The short name `s/` and full name `f/` of the new property are compulsory, while the constraint message `m/` and regular
expression for validation `r/` are optional. However, `m/` and `r/` must come together, i.e. a regular expression must be
accompanied by a constraint message, which will be shown when the validation fails.
* Short name is the identity (primary key) of all properties. Thus, the short name must be unique. The command will fail
if there is an existing property with the same short name.
* The given regular expression must use legal syntax. It will be checked by the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile-java.lang.String-[Pattern.compile] method.
****

Example:

* `config --add-property s/ag f/age`
* `config --add-property s/b f/birthday m/Birthday should be in the format of DD/MM/YYYY r/[^\s].*`

[NOTE]
====
* Short name is used as the prefix for `add`/`addE` and `edit`/`editE` commands.
* Full name is used to display the name of each property on the right panel (to show details of the selected person, see `select` command).
* Constraint message is the string that will be shown in result display box when the input value for this property in
`add`/`addE` and `edit`/`editE` commands is invalid.
* Regular expression is used to check whether the input value for this property is valid.
====

==== Set tag color : `(cfg)config --set-tag-color`

Sets the displayed color of a certain tag (for persons/events). +
Format: `(cfg)config --set-tag-color TAG_NAME COLOR`

****
* By default, the application will use a random color to display each tag. The same tags are displayed using the same
color, different tags are _usually_ displayed using different colors.
* The value of the parameter `COLOR` should be either one of the pre-defined color names or a valid RGB value (in hexadecimal,
starting with a `#`). You can pick the RGB value of your favorite color from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp[here].
* Pre-defined color names include _black_, _blue_, _brown_, _green_, _red_, _white_, _yellow_.
****

Example:

* `config --set-tag-color friends red`

=== Exiting the program : `(x)exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `(x)exit`

Example:

* `exit`

=== Saving the data
