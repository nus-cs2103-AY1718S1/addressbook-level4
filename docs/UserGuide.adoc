By: `CS2103T T09-B3 Team`      Since: `Sep 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `bonus.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#commands[commands] section below for details of each command.

== Components

**BoNUS** mainly consists on three components: *contacts*, *events* and *calendar*. They work independently and each is
considered as a kind of `data items`. They are described in details as follows:

=== Contacts

You can store personal information of your contacts (friends, classmates, professors, etc.) in **BoNUS**.

* By default, you can store and update their name, phone number, email address and mailing address. Refer to the `add`
and `edit` command in the section below for more information.
* You can store other information of your contacts by adding customize properties. Refer to the `config add-property`
command in the section below for more information.
* You can group your contacts by adding one or multiple tags to them. Contacts with the same tag will be classified
under the same group.

=== Events

You can store your upcoming events (meeting with professor tomorrow, assignment deadline, lecture/tutorial time slot, etc.) in **BoNUS**.

* By default, you can store and update their title, interval (starting time and end time), venue and description. Refer
to the `add` and `edit` command in the section below for more information.
* Similar to link:#contacts[contacts], you can add customize properties to events as well.
* Similar to link:#contacts[contacts], you can add tags to events as well.
* If you have set starting and/or end time for an event, it will be reflected accordingly on the link:#calendar[calendar] component.
* You can set notification at specific time before an event starts (when you should arrive at the venue before a meeting
begins) or at specific time before an event ends (when you need to finalize your assignment and submit it to your professor).
* You can link one or more link:#contacts[contacts] to an event (if all of you are going to attend the same meeting).

=== Calendar

Calender provides a more convenient interface for you to view your upcoming link:#events[events]. All events are displayed
based on their time interval. Events whose time intervals are not specified will not be displayed here.

* You can choose the style to display the upcoming events (weekly/monthly/yearly view).
* You can add/update/delete events here, but the actual operation will be handled by the link:#events[events] component.

== Key features

=== Convenient

**BoNUS** can provide ultimate convenience and save much time in your daily life.

* Import contacts from _iCloud_, _Google+_, _Facebook_, etc.
* Import events from _Google_ _Calendar_, _Outlook_ _Calendar_, etc.
* Sync between all your devices.
* (**Exclusive**) automatically generate your school schedule by simply entering your timetable URL from _https://nusmods.com/[NUSMods]_.

=== Fast

As long as the number of records stored is less than 50,000 and the size of the storage file is smaller than 20MB, **BoNUS**
is expected to

* Start the application in 5 seconds.
* Return the result of all link:#commands[commands] available with _human-invisible_ delay.
* Update things displayed on the GUI (graphic user interface) smoothly.

=== Secured

The **BoNUS** developers understand our users will store personal data in the application. We value privacy and security
a lot.

* All data saved to the storage file will be encrypted using the state-of-the-art encryption scheme.
* Users will be prompted to enter their password whenever they open the application.
* You can set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) if there is extra security requirement.

== Commands

The listing below shows a summary of all commands currently available to users and how to use them.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

====
*Command in different components*

* Most command can be applied to either a person or an event, whose result will depend on the context e.g. `add n/NAME`
will add a person if the user is currently in the link:#contacts[contacts] component, add an event otherwise.
* All commands entered in the link:#calendar[calendar] component will actually be handled by the link:#contacts[contacts]
component.

The index *must be a positive integer* like 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values of the selected data item will be updated to the input values.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] [p/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]]...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The search can be based on one or multiple properties. The short name of the property `n/` can be omitted if the searching
criteria is for the `name` property.
* Apply `OR` search for keywords of the same property, i.e. persons/events matching at least one keyword will be returned.
e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`. Thus, the order of the keywords for the same property does not matter.
 e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Apply `AND` search for keywords of the different property, i.e. only persons/events matching all of the required properties
will be returned. e.g. `Hans Bo p/84651943` will only return persons whose name contains either `Hans` or `Bo`, as well as,
whose phone number is the same as `84651943`.

are doing before using any of the following commands. These commands are intended for advance users.

==== Add new property : `config --add-property`

Adds a new property field available to persons/events. +
Format: `config --add-property s/b f/birthday [m/Birthday should be in the format of DD/MM/YYYY r/[^\s].*]`

****
* This command does not add a new property to a specific person. Instead, it defines a property that will be available to
all persons/events.
* The short name `s/` and full name `f/` of the new property are compulsory, while the constraint message `m/` and regular
expression for validation `r/` are optional. However, `m/` and `r/` must come together, i.e. a regular expression must be
accompanied by a constraint message, which will be shown when the validation fails.
* Short name is the identity (primary key) of all properties. Thus, the short name must be unique. The command will fail
if there is an existing property with the same short name.
* The given regular expression must use legal syntax. It will be checked by the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile-java.lang.String-[Pattern.compile] method.
