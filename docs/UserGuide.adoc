== About

Sometimes do you feel that you have too many contacts and cannot manage them clearly? Or sometimes you have too many events and cannot remember all the participants involved in those events? Do not worry! Planno can help you to solve these problems! +

Planno is an assistant that helps you to manage your contacts and events. It can tell you who the participants are of a particular event. Moreover, it can tell you your contacts join in which event. +

Planno is a command-line based application, and it has very few click buttons. Hence, you only need to remember some very simple command format to make full use of Planno’s function. +

This user guide will give you a step by step instruction on how you can start up and use Planno, and a brief introduction of the features you can use in Planno. +

== Getting Started

Before we start our journey on Planno, here are some simple steps for you to launch this application:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `planno.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to a *clean folder* that you want to use as the home folder for Planno.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds, as shown in the figure below.
   Note that you will see some initial data if it is the first time to use.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
_Figure 2: GUI_
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. If you type *`help`* and press kbd:[Enter], Planno will open the help window for you.
.  Try some sample commands like these:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Person List.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app
+
[NOTE]
For the details of each command, please refer to Features section.
+
. Congratulations! Now you have successfully launched Planno, and you can start trying this application. If you have any trouble in launching Planno, please refer to FAQ and solve your problems.

== Features

As mentioned in the ABOUT, Planno supports command lines to perform its features. In this section, you will know what command format Planno supports, and what features Planno provides.

=== General

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Command key wards are *case sensitive*. e.g. only `help` means help command, while `HELP`, `HElp`, `hElP` are not.
====

====
*How does Planno Look Like*

Planno consists of the following 4 components: +

* Command Box: it is a single line below the FILE button where you should enter your command.
* Result Display: it is the black box below command box where the feedback of you command will be displayed. The feedback is a message that indicates whether your command has been successfully executed. +
* Person List: it is a red panel that contains a list of person cards (see Figure 3.1.1). Each person card displays a person’s name, tags, phone number, email, address and birthday.

image::UG_personListPanel.png[]
_Figure 3.1.1: person list panel_

* Event List: it is a blue panel that contains a list of event cards (see Figure 3.1.2). Each event card displays an event’s name, description and date. Also, a number with an arrow sits on the right side of the event card.
  If the event date is before today, the number will be appended with an up arrow, indicating how many days have passed since the event date.
  Otherwise, if the event date is after today, the number will be appended with a down arrow, indicating how many days are left before the event.

image::UG_eventListPanel.png[]
_Figure 3.1.2: event list panel_

* Information Board: it is a green panel displays the result of some commands. For example, the results of `displayEmails` command will display a list of emails in the information board.

Now that you are familiar with what each part of Planno does, you can now continue to take a look at the commands Planno supports.

* The EVENT_TIME must be after 01/01/1900
* Every event will have a number indicating the of days till or since the event date.
** If the event date has passed, an up arrow will be appended to the numbr to indicate how many days have passed since the evnet date.
** If the event date is not yet reached, a down arrow will be appended to the number to indicate the number of days till the event.
****

****
* If the evnet to be add in an addE command is `out-dated` (ie. event date has passed), an alert dialog will pop up.
This dialog (shown in Figure 3.1.1) will ask you whether you want to add this out-dated event into Planno.
