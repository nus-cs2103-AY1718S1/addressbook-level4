== Introduction

Rolodex is a desktop contact management application for people who have many social circles and wish to organise different groups of contacts separately and efficiently. +
If you are a businessmen with a long list of clients to keep in touch with, a teacher with the contact information of hundreds of students in your phone,
a freelancer with multiple groups of co-workers or customers, or just anyone with a need for fast and easy contact management, Rolodex is perfect for you.

== Quick Start

This section serves as a tutorial for you to familiarize yourself with the usage of Rolodex.
By following the steps below, getting started with Rolodex should be a fast and smooth process.

=== Installation

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
Rolodex will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `rolodex.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Rolodex.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. You should see the GUI (Graphical User Interface) in a few seconds as shown below.
+

=== User Interface

The following picture labels the main components of the application.

image::UiLabeled.png[width="790"]

The table below summarises the function of each component.

[width=100%, cols="1,3"]
|===

| Command Box | This is where you type in your commands to tell Rolodex to perform actions.
| Command Result Panel | After entering a command, the feedback/result will be displayed here. +
This is to notify you whether the command is valid, and to inform you if the action has been executed successfully.
| Contact List | All contacts are listed here in alphabetical order by default. +
When you perform a search action, the search result will be displayed here.
| Contact Detail Panel | When you select a contact in Contact List, his/her details (name, phone number, email, address, tags and remark) will be displayed here.
|===

=== Executing Commands

.  Type the command (case insensitive) in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to Rolodex.

[TIP]
The standard format for keying in person details is `PREFIX/PERSON_DETAIL` (e.g. `n/John Doe` for keying in a name). +
The following table summarizes the prefixes and the corresponding person details they represent. +

[width=30%, cols="2,3"]
|===
| Prefix | Person Detail

| n/ | Name
| p/ | Phone
| e/ | Email
| a/ | Address
| r/ | Remark
| t/ | Tag
|===

For the details of each command, you may refer to the link:#features[Features] section below.
