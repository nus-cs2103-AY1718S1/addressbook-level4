== Introductio`n

=== What is Rubrika?

Welcome to Rubrika! +

Rubrika is a desktop Address Book application that lets you store and manage your contacts in a convenient manner.

Rubrika revolutionises the way you interact with an Address Book Application. We have done away with the traditional buttons, and now allow users to interact through the Command Line Interface.

This guide will familiarise you with the basic commands that you will need to start using Rubrika.


== Quick Start

Before we start, please make sure you follow the steps below to install Rubrika.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
If you are missing Java 8, you may download it for free [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here]]

+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#Features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== What's New in Version 1.4

=== Enhanced Autocomplete

Autocomplete should now be able to autocomplete person data based on command word given too.

Example: `removetag fa` +
Autocompletes to all tags starting with `fa`.

Autocomplete should also work no matter where in the input you are currently trying to modify, unless there are no options to autocomplete.

=== Import and Export Contacts : `import` and `export`

You can now import and export vCard files from Rubrika, with `import` and `export` command respectively.

=== Change UI Theme : `theme`

You can now set the theme of the UI to suit your preference, with `theme` command.

// tag::autocomplete[]
== Autocomplete

The Autocomplete feature comes together with Rubrika, and further improves your experience with using CLI, shortening time required to input commands greatly. +
Autocomplete comes in many shapes and forms, and shall be explained to you in detail as follows.

=== Autocomplete Command

You may use `Tab` key to automatically generate a command 'skeleton' from an incomplete command word input. +
Long command words are no longer a hassle to type and some command syntax that are too tough to remember are also generated for you.

Examples:

* `c` becomes `clear` after pressing `Tab` once
* nothing happens to `b` (no command starting with letter `b`)
* `h` becomes `history`, and then `help` if you press `Tab` again

=== Autocomplete Person Data Based on Prefix

You may also use `Tab` key to automatically complete personal data, based on prefix like `n/` or `a/` given. +
This helps with wordy addresses or long names and other person data you do not want to type out in full.

* `add n/J` becomes `add n/John Hawkins` if you have a person with the name `John Hawkins` stored
* `edit 2 t/co t/owesMoney` does not autocomplete the `t/co` because it is in the middle of the input
* `select 2` does not autocomplete because there is no prefix present, and no person data should be involved

=== Autocomplete Person Data Based on Command Word

`Tab` key also automatically complete person data based on the command word given. +
You can even find someone without executing the `find` command, but just let Autocomplete feature help you.

* `find A` gets completed with all possible keywords starting with `A`
* `removetag fa` becomes `removetag` followed by all possible tags starting with `fa`
* `delete 1` does not autocomplete because the command does not involve person data

=== Autocomplete Anywhere in the Command Input Box

`Tab` key can be used almost anywhere in the command input box. +
You can go back to complete or modify any particulars you may have missed out.

// end::autocomplete[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder. Alternatively, you may export your contacts into a vCard file and transfer the file to the other Computer and import the vCard file from there.

== Command Summary

* *Add* `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]...` +
