== Features

=== Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in *square brackets* are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be optionally used multiple times or not at all:

_e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc._

* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Command words can be replaced by their specified aliases e.g. `delete INDEX` is the same as `d INDEX`.


[TIP]
Once you have familiarized yourself with the application, try typing a command's alias in place of the full command keyword to save more time!
