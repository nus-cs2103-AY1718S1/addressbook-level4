== Introduction

As the name implies, link:{repoURL}[**BoNUS**] helps you _better(B) organize(o) your NUS life_.

* As an NUS student, do you feel like your schedules are all over the place and your contacts are too messy making searching through it a pain?
* Sounds like you need a "Bonus"!
* Our **BoNUS** is a desktop personal organizer application dedicated to NUS students to carry out various tasks such as storing
contacts, scheduling for upcoming events, timetable planning as well as a calendar to better organise your campus life.
* Apart from storing essential information such as name, email, address and phone number, you have _infinite freedom_
to customize your own fields!
* **BoNUS** is convenient, fast, secured, integrated, solely with the motivation of giving you a bonus for your student
life in NUS. It is also oriented for typist users (most operations should be done using keyboard rather than mouse), which makes it all the more simple!

Let's begin!

=== Purpose
This user guide will provide you with a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to better utilise **BoNUS**
to make your NUS life a breeze.

== Quick Start

.  Start by ensuring you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
If you only have earlier versions of Java 8, this app will not work.
+
.  Download the latest `bonus.jar` release from link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Create a folder you want to use as home folder for **BoNUS** and copy the `jar` you have downloaded there.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

_Figure 2.1 : User Interface Demo_

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#commands[commands] section below for details of each command.

== Components

**BoNUS** consists of three main components: *contacts*, *events* and *calendar* which you can select using the sidebar on the left-hand side.

image::UiSideBarHighlight.png[width="500"]
_Figure 3.1 : Sidebar for Switching between Different Components_

They are described in details as follows:

=== Contacts

Time to deal with the many contacts you have accumulated while studying in NUS.

* By default, you can store and update names, phone numbers, email and mailing addresses. (`add`
and `edit` command)
* Additionally, you can customize an additional field to a contact that is not in the default. (`config add-property`
command)
* Now, let's organize all your contacts by adding one or more tags to them. Those with the same tag will be classified
under the same group. You can even customize the colour of the tags to your liking. (`config --set-tag-color` command)

=== Events

Got a meeting with professor or an assignment deadline you need to remember?

* By default, you can store and update the title, interval (starting time and end time), venue and description of the event. (`addE` and `editE` command)
* Similar to link:#contacts[contacts], you can add customize properties and add tags to events as well.
* Setting a starting and/or end time for an event, will be reflected accordingly on the link:#calendar[calendar] component.
* Reminders will automatically be added upon addition of event and start to notify you from 2 days before the actual event.
* If one or more of your link:#contacts[contacts] are attending the event with you, you can link them to the event too.

=== Calendar

_(Coming in v2.0)_

Calender provides a clearer image for you to view your upcoming link:#events[events]. All events are displayed
based on their time interval for you to be able to attend to them one by one. However, events without time intervals will not be displayed here.

* You can choose the style to display the upcoming events (weekly/monthly/yearly view).
* You can add/update/delete events here, but the actual operation will be handled by the link:#events[events] component.

== Key features

=== Convenient

**BoNUS** is the ultimate application as it will provide you with the utmost convenience and gives you more time to focus on your more important tasks.

* Import contacts from _iCloud_, _Google+_, _Facebook_, etc.
* Import events from _Google_ _Calendar_, _Outlook_ _Calendar_, etc.
* Export data (contacts and events) to `.xml` file (default storage format for **BoNUS**), Excel Worksheet, etc.
* Sync between all your devices.
* (**Exclusive**) automatically generate your school schedule by simply entering your timetable URL from _https://nusmods.com/[NUSMods]_.

=== Fast

As long as the number of records stored is less than 50,000 and the size of the storage file is smaller than 20MB, **BoNUS**
will be able to

* Start the application in 5 seconds.
* Return the result of all link:#commands[commands] available with _human-invisible_ delay.
* Update things displayed on the GUI (graphic user interface) smoothly.

=== Secured

The **BoNUS** developers understand that you will be storing personal data in the application. The following are features of our application that ensures
you will have privacy and security.

* All data saved to the storage file will be encrypted using the state-of-the-art encryption scheme (AES-256).
* You will be prompted to enter their password whenever they open the application (if you has decided to lock your application
the last time before you exited).
* You can set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) to fulfill extra security requirement(s).

== Commands

The following is a list of commands that you can use in the application.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in parentheses represent the command shortcut e.g. in `(a)add n/NAME`, `a` is the shorthand-equivalent notation for the `add` command.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` is information to be supplied by you e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is to be filled in by you.
e.g `add n/John Doe`.
* Words in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, `t/TAG` is optional.
e.g `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used from zero times to as many times as you like e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* You can type the information in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`
works too.
* If parameters with the same prefix are typed multiple times, only the last one will be taken. For example,
`n/John Doe n/Martin Henz`, then only `Martin Henz` will be taken into actual consideration.
====

====
*Command in different components*

* Most commands can be applied to either a person or an event, whose result will depend on the context e.g. `add` will add
a person if the user is currently in the link:#contacts[contacts] component, otherwise `addE` will add a new link:#events[event].
* All commands entered in the link:#calendar[calendar] component will actually be handled by either link:#contacts[contacts]
component or link:#events[events] component.
====

=== Viewing help : `(h)help`

Have a query? Use the `help` command! +
Format: `(h)help` (or press `F1` on the keyboard)

=== Adding a person : `(a)add`

You just met someone and want to add their contact information into your contact list. +
Format: `(a)add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

This adds the person to your contact list.

[TIP]
Your contact can have any number of tags (including 0).

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

[TIP]
In a similar format, you can also add customize properties when adding a new person, just use `config --add-property`
command before to define that property. +
Notice all pre-defined properties (name, phone, email, address) are compulsory when adding a new person, while customize
properties are optional.

Example:

If you want to add birthday as a field for a contact and use `b` as the short name,

* `config --add-property s/b f/birthday`

Then, you can set a contact's `birthday` when you add a new contact (_see `b/12091191` below_)

* `add n/Chris Lee p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/23 Chinatown b/12091991 t/friends`

//tag::autoReminders[]
=== Adding an event : `(aE)addE`

You want to record your friend's birthday party coming up. +
Format: `(aE)addE n/NAME dt/DATE_TIME a/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`

This will add a new event to your list of events.

Examples:

* `addE n/Does Birthday dt/25122015 20:30 a/12 Kent Ridge Drive`
* `addE n/Betsy Birthday dt/25122016 21:30 a/23 Marina Road`

[NOTE]
====
* The standard format for time should be `DDMMYYYY HH:MM` in 24-hour format.
* However, the application may sometimes be _smart_ enough to interpret what you typed. For example, if you type `this afternoon`
or `tomorrow evening`, it will be automatically converted to the standard format.
* Do NOT try to _challenge_ the application, it is not promised to produce an expected result if you use non-standard format
or if the expression is not simple or clear enough.
* Avoid putting the year first when using the non-standard format.
====


[TIP]
====
* Reminders will automatically be added and start to notify you from 2 days before the actual event.
* Reminders in the form of a bell image will be displayed on the event card itself.
* Red Bell : Day of event +
  Orange Bell: One day before event +
  Green Bell: Two days before event

* However, it must end with an extension of `.xls` (`.xlsx` is currently not supported).
****

Examples:

* For `Windows` users: +
`export --excel C:\Users\John Doe\Documents\bonus.xls`

* For `macOS` and `Linux` users: +
`export --excel /Users/John Doe/Documents/bonus.xls`

[NOTE]
====
For `Windows` users, use `\` as the name-separator in your `FILEPATH`. +
For `macOS` and `Linux` users, use `/` instead.
====
// end::exportExcel[]

=== Advance setting : `(cfg)config`

Changes the configuration of the application or applies some advance settings to the data. Make sure you know what you
are doing before using any of the following commands. These commands are intended for advance users.

// tag::genericProperty[]
==== Adding a customize property : `(cfg)config --add-property`

Adds a new customize property field available to all persons or events. +
Format: `(cfg)config --add-property s/SHORT_NAME f/FULL_NAME [m/MESSAGE r/REGULAR_EXPRESSION]`

****
* This command does not add a new property to a specific person. Instead, it defines a property that will be available to
all persons/events.
* The short name `s/` and full name `f/` of the new property are compulsory, while the constraint message `m/` and regular
expression for validation `r/` are optional. However, `m/` and `r/` must come together, i.e. a regular expression must be
accompanied by a constraint message, which will be shown when the validation fails.
* If constraint message and regular expression are not specified, the default would be `[^\s].*`, which mean the value of
this property cannot be blank.
* Short name is the identity (primary key) of all properties. Thus, the short name must be unique. The command will fail
if there is an existing property with the same short name.
* The given regular expression must use legal syntax. It will be checked by the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile-java.lang.String-[Pattern.compile] method.
****

Example:

* `config --add-property s/ag f/age`
* `config --add-property s/b f/birthday m/Birthday should be in the format of DD/MM/YYYY r/[^\s].*`

[NOTE]
====
* Short name is used as the prefix for `add`/`addE` and `edit`/`editE` commands.
* Full name is used to display the name of each property on the right panel (to show details of the selected person, see `select` command).
* Constraint message is the string that will be shown in result display box when the input value for this property in
`add`/`addE` and `edit`/`editE` commands is invalid.
* Regular expression is used to check whether the input value for this property is valid.
====
// end::genericProperty[]

==== Setting the tag color : `(cfg)config --set-tag-color`

_(Tag feature for events coming in v2.0)_

Sets the displayed color of a certain tag (for persons/events). +
Format: `(cfg)config --set-tag-color TAG_NAME COLOR`

****
* By default, the application will use a random color to display each tag. The same tags are displayed using the same
color, different tags are _usually_ displayed using different colors.
* The value of the parameter `COLOR` should be either one of the 140 pre-defined color names or a valid RGB value (a 3-bit
or 6-bit hexadecimal number starting with a `#`).
* You can pick the RGB value of your favorite color from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp[here].
* All legal pre-defined color names can be found from https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#typecolor[here].
****

Example:

* `config --set-tag-color friends red`

[NOTE]
====
If you enter an invalid color name, the background for that tag will be set to transparent temporarily. You can use this
again to set it to a legal color.

=== Booking of NUS facilities: `(book)bookNUS`

_(Exclusive feature for NUS students)_ +
