This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `Intelli.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to Intelli.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

****
* The indexes of the persons are based on the most recent listing shown.
* The direction of the relationship can only be `directed` or `undirected`. The direction is case-insensitive.
* The order of the indexes matters only when the direction is `directed`, as the relationship points from the person with FROM_INDEX to the person with TO_INDEX.
* At any point of time there will be at most 1 relationship between any two persons. If adding a different relationship from the existing one between two persons is attempted, upon the addition the previous relationship between these two persons will be removed.
* `NAME` referring to the name of the relationship *can only be alphanumeric*.
* `CONFIDENCE_ESTIMATE` refers to the confidence estimate the user gives to the relationship. `CONFIDENCE_ESTIMATE` *can only be numbers from 0 to 100 inclusive*.

* If only one attribute is updated (e.g. `editRelationship 1 2 n/NAME`), the other attribute will retain its original value in the pre-edited relationship.
* `NAME`, which refers to the name of the relationship *can only be alphanumeric*.
* `CONFIDENCE_ESTIMATE` refers to the confidence estimate the user gives to the relationship. `CONFIDENCE_ESTIMATE` *can only be numbers from 0 to 100 inclusive*.
* The graph does not display confidence estimates that have the value 0.
