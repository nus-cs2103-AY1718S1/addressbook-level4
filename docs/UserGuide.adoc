== About
What’s the first thing you think about when you hear the words _“command line interface (CLI)”_?
Do you think of environments like the picture below, and feel daunted by it?

_Figure 1: Command Line Interface_

Rest assured, Circles is here to help. +
Circles is a personal address book that stores and organises your contacts and their contact information,
displaying them in a neat and organised fashion. +

It’s only caveat is that you, the user, can only control it using a CLI. Circles helps you practise using a
CLI in a more comfortable environment, and gets you used to using a single string of words to execute your commands by
making the commands as intuitive as possible. +

So now that you know what Circles can do for you, let’s dive into how to use Circles.


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

2. The following message will appear if the edit was successful. (As shown in Figure 5) +
_E.g: Edited Person: John Doe Phone: 98765432 Email: johnd@gmail.com Address: Blk 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 Tags: [owesMoney][friends]_

image::Figure5.png[width="790"]

****


[TIP]
The INDEX must be a positive integer greater than 0. +

2. Contact cards with relevant matching text will be displayed (As shown in Figure 6)
