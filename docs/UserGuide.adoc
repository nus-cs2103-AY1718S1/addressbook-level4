== Introduction

Many universities have a timetable committee to deal with all matters concerning timetabling scheduling.
One concern would be timetable clashes while scheduling. +

Welcome to ModU, a timetable scheduling software for professors and administrators in tertiary institutions. +

With ModU, you are able to easily identify timetable slots that are available for the module you are scheduling.
Made a mistake while scheduling the timetable? Fret not, you can easily make any changes to the timetable. +

The main input of ModU is through the use of command line interface (CLI).
The natural language input field will allow you to quickly search, add, delete and edit your timetable.
Just type what you want and ModU will do the rest for you! +

This user guide will explain how the various commands in ModU can be carried out by giving valid examples.
It also includes a scenario where it lists the different situations that you might encounter and how ModU is able to help you overcome them.
The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section that lists answers to commonly asked questions can be found at the end of the user guide, followed by a summary of the commands available in ModU.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ModU.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The The graphical user interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::mainUi.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
    +
    Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* *`module`* : lists all module. +
* *`add`* *`m/MA1101R ct/LEC v/LT27 gp/1 ts/FRI[1400-1600] l/ Ma Siu Lun`* : adds a lesson with module code `MA1101R` to the ModU list. +
* *`sort`* : sort lesson shown in the current list. +
* *`exit`* : exits the app. +

Please refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

*We want your experience with ModU to be as positive as possible.
Hence, please read the following information so that you will understand the command format.*


====
*Command Format*

* Certain commands require prefixes before the parameters. It will be stated clearly whether prefixes are required.
Prefixes are characters followed by a backslash, for example: `m/`, `l/`, `gp/`, `ts/` and more. +

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user
e.g. in add m/MODULE, MODULE is a parameter that represents the module code such as MA1101R.
The command will then look like this: add m/MA1101R. +

* Parameters in square brackets are optional. For example, m/MODULE l/LECTURER [l/LECTURER] can be executed by
typing m/MA1101R l/Ma Siu Lun l/Victor Tan or m/MA1101R l/Ma Siu Lun. +

* Parameters followed by “…” can be entered multiple times.
For example, l/LECTURER… can be entered as l/Ma Siu Lun l/Victor Tan l/Alex Neo and more. +

* Parameters can be in any order. For example, if the command example states this particular
order gp/GROUP ts/TIME_SLOT ct/CLASS_TYPE, rearranging the order to ts/TIME_SLOT ct/CLASS_TYPE gp/GROUP is also acceptable.

====

====
*List modes*

These are the 4 list modes currently supported by ModU. They will be further explained in link:#listing-all-lesson-code-list-code[Listing all lessons: list]. +
* Module list mode +
* Location list mode +

== Tutorial

Assume you are a professor from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and
you want to start planning your timetable for the upcoming semester.
The university has introduced you to ModU, an effective timetable scheduling software developed by
the School of Computing (SoC) students.


This is the screen when you first launch ModU. +

image::tutorial/NewUi.png[width="790"]

* `Command Box`: receive user command inputs
* `Resust Display Box`: display result of the commands
* `Module/Lesson Display Panel`: display list of modules or lessons
* `Timetable/Browser`: display timetable of a particular module or a browser when a location is selected


Since this is the first time you are using this software, you are unsure of what are the available commands.

Type `help` in the command box. ModU will open up the user guide that will list all available commands in ModU.

image::tutorial/Help.png[width="790"]

After you have read through the commands, you realised that it is difficult to remember all the different commands.
You want to be able to identify key words, prefix and check the validity of command.


Type `color enable` in the command box. ModU will highlight the various commands and prefix.
It will display a tick when the command is valid or a cross when the command is invalid.

image::tutorial/colorEnable.png[width="790"]

After you have received the course information from CS2101 and MA1101R,
you would want to enter these information into ModU.

Type `add m/MA1101R ct/LEC v/LT27 gp/1 ts/FRI[1400-1600] l/ Ma Siu Lun` in the command box.
ModU will create a module MA1101R for you and automatically insert the lesson particulars into this module

image::tutorial/addModule.png[width="790"]

Now you want to add a new lesson for CS2101. However, you did not notice that the lesson
has the same time slot and location as the MA1101R lesson that you have just added.

When you type `add CS2101 ct/LEC v/LT27 gp/1 ts/FRI[1400-1600] l/ Ma Siu Lun` in the command box,
ModU will inform you that the time slot is already booked.

image::tutorial/addDup.png[width="790"]

After you have added all the lessons for MA1101R , you might want to know how the current time table for MA1101R
looks like.

Type `view 1` in the command box.
ModU will show you all available lesson information about MA1101R.
ModU will also also display the timetable for this module.
In addition, you can continue adding MA1101R lessons in the command box and it will reflect on the timetable
instantaneously.

image::tutorial/viewMod.png[width="790"]
image::tutorial/viewAdd.png[width="790"]

Now, you received a notice that MA1101R has been renamed to MA1010 and you wish to edit the timetable.

Type `edit 1 MA1010` in the command box.
In the module view, ModU allows you to change the name of the module.
All the lessons with the code MA1101R will be changed to MA1010.

image::tutorial/editMod.png[width="790"]

One of the lecturers from CS2101 lost her timetable and she wants
you to send her a new one. You need to firstly find CS2101 from a list of modules.

Type `find CS2101` followed by `view 1` in the command box.
ModU will show you the timetable for CS2101.

image::tutorial/findMod.png[width="790"]
image::tutorial/findTimetable.png[width="790"]

Maybe you have to take more classes during this semester.
After you have added these lessons into ModU, you would want to have an organized view by arranging them in an
alphabetical order

Type `sort` in the command box.
ModU sorts the current list based on alphabetical order.
Take note that you can do the same for lesson list.

image::tutorial/sort.png[width="790"]

You were informed that LT19 needs reconstruction and is not open for the upcoming semester.
Now, you need to delete LT19 from ModU.

Type `list location` followed by `delete 2` in the command box.
ModU will delete all lessons that are scheduled in LT19.

image::tutorial/delete.png[width="790"]

Almost immediately after you have deleted LT19, you received a call saying that the reconstruction will only happen
during the following semester. Don't worry, all you need to do is simply undo the previous command.

Type `undo` in the command box.
ModU will undo the deletion and restore LT19.

image::tutorial/undo.png[width="790"]

A moment later, you were informed to ignore the previous call and that LT19 will indeed go through reconstruction
this upcoming semester (oh, don't we all hate workplace miscommunications). ModU got you covered this time round as
well.

Type `redo` in the command box.
ModU will undo the previous `undo` command.

image::tutorial/redo.png[width="790"]

After the semester ends, you would want to clear the timetable and prepare for the next semester.

Type `clear` in the command box.
ModU will clear all modules in the timetable.

image::tutorial/clear.png[width="790"]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the computer that you want to transfer the data to and overwrite the empty data file
it creates with the file that contains the data in your ModU folder stored in the previous computer.

*Q*: How do I get support? +
*A*: if you have any questions, you can contact us by mailto:liangcao@yahoo.com[email].
