== Introduction

=== About Bamboo
Bamboo is a command-line interface (CLI) based address book application. It is a one-stop solution to help you manage your contacts in an efficient and convenient manner. Using Bamboo, you can organize contacts into groups, obtain your contacts' Google Calendar events and get connected to your contacts’ social media platforms.

=== Purpose
This document serves as the User Guide for Bamboo. It assumes that you have a basic understanding of how to use simple CLI applications. It describes how to get started with Bamboo and how to use Bamboo’s features by walking you through some examples.

== Getting Started

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `bamboo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  6.	You can try the following command examples:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3 4 5` : deletes the 3rd, 4th and 5th contacts shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features
In this increasingly connected world that we live in, it is difficult to manage contact information and stay connected to the people that you meet. To help you, Bamboo is designed to show your contacts, groups and contact information in a fuss-free and concise manner.

image::layout.png[width="790"]

Upon launching Bamboo, you will notice that there are three distinct panels - *Contacts*, *Groups* and a *Contact Detail* panel.

* The *Contact* panel shows you all your contacts at a glance. Details such as the contact’s address, email and phone are omitted so you do not get bombarded with a slew of redundant information when you are looking for a person.

* The *Groups* panel shows you all your groups at a glance. You can create groups to help organize and manage your contacts in a more logical and systematic manner. 

* The *Contact Detail* panel shows you the details of your contact such as their phone, email and address. You will be able to view a person’s schedule and get connected with their social media accounts. 

As Bamboo is primarily a CLI-based application, most of your interaction with Bamboo will be through command inputs. 
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
