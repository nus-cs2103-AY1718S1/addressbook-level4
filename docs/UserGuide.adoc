This user guide gives you an overview of how to use Codii.
This guide includes step-by-step instructions on how each command work, FAQs and a summary of every command you will learn.

The terms used in this guide are as follows: +

== Introduction

Codii is a free-to-use address book catered to suit the needs of debt collectors. You can enter debtors into Codii,
track the amount of debt owed, manage deadlines, ban and unban debtors and even organise them by location.

Codii is available for the Linux, Windows, and Mac OS operating systems.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `codii.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Codii.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI, as seen in Figure 1.1 below, should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe hp/98765432 home/60773707 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 pc/321123 d/123 dl/11-12-2018` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

// tag::login[]
=== Logging into the address book application using Command Line Interface (CLI) : `login`

Logs into the address book. +
Format: `login USERNAME PASSWORD`

[NOTE]
It is advisable to use the GUI login instead of the CLI login. +
The current implementation for password masking in the CLI login is less sophisticated than the GUI login.
This can lead to unexpected or incorrect behaviors such as inconsistent masking of password or being unable to log in when username and password are entered correctly. +
To reduce unexpected behaviors, users are advised to add or delete characters from the end of the command only. +
*The CLI login option is available for convenience only given that we want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI.*

Examples:

* `login userAcc_123 pa$$_Word!@#&`
* `login batMan_111 (Batcave.327+-)`

[NOTE]
Sample account to log into address book: +
Username: *loanShark97* +

2) Enter username and password in the respective fields. +
3) Press kbd:[Enter] or click the `Log in` button. +

To return to the command box, click the `Back to command box` button.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous address Book. +

*Q*: What is the difference between `repaid` command and `payback` command? +

transferred to whitelist and date repaid is set to the date the command is executed. +

*Q*: If I `delete` someone from the `masterlist`, will he/she be deleted from the other lists as well? +
*A*: Yes. +

*Q*: Is it possible to send a blacklisted person to the `whitelist`? +
*A*: No. You have to `unban` the person prior to sending him/her to the `whitelist`. +

*Q*: When will a debtor's `debt` be accrued by his/her loan's interest rate? +
*A*: As of now, the default date to accrue is on the first day of the month. +
