== Reported Bugs
The wrong person gets deleted from the list when we delete a person after using the find command, and use undo and redo commands immediately after.

If list originally contains: +
1. Alex +
2. Robert +
3. Roy +

Sequence of commands: +
find Roy (Roy is found) +
delete 1 (Roy is deleted) +
undo (Roy is back in the list) +
redo (Alex is deleted instead of Roy) +

AddressBook deletes the person at the top of the list instead of deleting the same person we previously deleted when using redo.
This is a bug that has existed in the original AdderessBook itself, has not been fixed yet (difficult to fix currently due to presence of multiple
lists in the current implementation of AddressBook).
