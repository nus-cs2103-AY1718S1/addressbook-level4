== Welcome to Unify
image::UG_mainheader_introduction.png[width="900"]
{sp}

=== Do More with Less
Unify is a Command Line Interface AddressBook that helps you manage your contacts efficiently. Unlike conventional Address Books, Unify adopts a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
By having a CLI, you can navigate and manage Unify efficiently by typing commands.
Commands capture the important details of your action into a concise line.
With just one line, you can traverse your large network to find your old pal John or update your Brother's phone number.
Now you can spend less time in your Address Book, and more time on what matters most to you.


=== First Time CLI User?

* Don't fret! Unify offers inline hints to prompt you what to type next,
+
image::UG_Hints.png[width="300"]
+
and will validate your input as you type. +
+
image::UG_Validation.png[width="300"]
+
* Afraid you will accidentally delete your girlfriend's details? We've got you covered! The `undo` command lets you revert any important changes to prevent any future embarrassment/pain. +
* Still lost? You can type `help` to access the User Guide whenever you need. +
* Unify will guide you along the way so that you can turn from Novice to Master in no time! +
