== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder. +

*Q*: What is the difference between `repaid` command and `payback` command? +

transferred to whitelist and date repaid is set to the date the command is executed. +

*Q*: If I `delete` someone from the `masterlist`, will he/she be deleted from the other lists as well? +
*A*: Yes. +

*Q*: Is it possible to send a blacklisted person to the `whitelist`? +
*A*: No. You have to `unban` the person prior to sending him/her to the `whitelist`. +

*Q*: When will a debtor's `debt` be accrued by his/her loan's interest rate? +
*A*: As of now, the default date to accrue is on the first day of the month. +
