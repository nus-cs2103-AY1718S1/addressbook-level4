== About

Sometimes do you feel that you have too many contacts but cannot manage them clearly? Or sometimes you have too many events but cannot remember all the participants involved in a event? Do not worry! Planno can help you to solve these problems!

Planno is a assistant that helps you to manage your contacts and events. It will tell you who are the participants according to the event. Moreover, it can tell you your contacts join in which event.

Planno is more powerful than the other contact managers or task managers and it combines these two types of application into one. Furthermore, Planno is very simple to use and you only need to type some short commands. There are no click buttons and the program will only execute the command according to what you type.

Do you feel excited? Let's get started!

== Getting Started

Before we start our journey on Planno, here are some simple steps for you to launch this application:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds, as shown in the figure below.
   Note that you will see some initial data if it is the first time to use.
+

_Figure 2: GUI_
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app
+
[NOTE]
For the details of each command, please refer to Features section.
+
.  Congratulations! If you can run Planno without any trouble, you can start trying this application. Otherwise, Please refer to FAQ and solve your problems.

== Features

=== General

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Command key wards are *case sensitive*. e.g. only `help` means help command, while `HELP`, `HElp`, `hElP` are not.
