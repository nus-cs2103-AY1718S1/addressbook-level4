== Introduction
Unable to keep track of all your deliveries?
Unsure which parcel is a more urgent delivery?
Did you ever wish there was a way you could easily find your delivery destination?
Now with Ark, you no longer need to worry about late deliveries and getting lost.
Leave the heavy thinking to us and just deliver away! +

Ark is a delivery parcel manager with the ability to keep track of your delivery details.
These details include recipient's names, delivery due dates, locations, and tags.
Ark is also able to help you plan out your delivery route by using google maps
to help you get to your destination. +

== About
This user guide gives you an overall view of the features of Ark and how to get started using Ark.
The user guide includes all of Arks functions and how to use them,
as well as providing you examples for easy reference. +

Ark assumes that you already have the postal codes of the delivery locations
of every parcel and searches for addresses by postal codes only.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `ark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Ark application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

of the delivery addresses of each parcel. This feature will be automatically used whenever you type `select`
into the command box or click on a Parcel Card, and will display a Google Maps search of the postal code
of the parcel's address in the browser section of the main window.

image::Ark_Browser.png[width="890"]
_Figure 4.11.1 : Selecting a parcel_

Every time you select a parcel, the Browser Panel will show as the Parcel List Panel minimizes.
As seen in figure 4.11.1 above, when the parcel belonging to Cornelia Meier, at index 4, is selected,
the Parcel List Panel minimizes, showing the Browser Panel and  it displays the delivery destination address
of the parcel. In this case, Cornelia wants her parcel to be delivered to 10th Street Singapore 123114.

//tag::tooltip[]

[#tool-tip]
==== Parcel Tooltip

Ark comes with a tooltip feature that allows you to view parcel details that are too long. Suppose you have entered
a parcel with really long details into Ark. As seen below, John's parcel has a delivery address that is too long,
and a part of it has been replaced by ellipsis i.e. `...` as seen in figure 4.21.1 below.

image::ParcelWithLongInput.PNG[width="1000"]
_Figure 4.21.1 : Parcel with a long address_

To view the full delivery address, we simply mouseover his address and the full details of his
address will appear as a tooltip. This can be seen in figure 4.22.2 below.

image::mouse-over-address.png[width="1000"]
_Figure 4.22.2 : Tooltip to show more of John's address_

//end::tooltip[]

//tag::gui-tab[]

=== GUI tab mechanism

To help you organise between the parcels you have delivered and the parcels you have delivered, Ark provides you two
lists, one containing the parcels you have yet to deliver, and the other, the parcels that you have already delivered.

When you launch the application, Ark will show the list of undelivered parcels in your inventory. To view
the list of delivered parcels, you can click on the `Completed Parcel` tab located on the Tab Panel of Ark.

image::completed-parcel-list.PNG[width="1000"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Clicking on `Completed Parcel` tab_

As seen above in figure 4.3.1, the list has changed to the list of parcels that have been delivered. To revert back to the list of
parcels that have not been delivered, simply click on the `All Parcels` tab.

[NOTE]
Parcels that have a `COMPLETED` status will be added to the list of delivered parcels directly while Parcels
that do not have a `COMPLETED` status will  be added to the list of undelivered parcels.

//end::gui-tab[]

//tag::overduePopup[]

=== Overdue Parcels Popup Window

Every time you startup Ark, if you have any parcels with the status `OVERDUE` in the parcel list,
a separate window will popup notifying you of the number of overdue parcels that are in the list.
The popup window will show for 7 seconds before closing itself. You can also close the window manually by clicking
the `x` at the top right of the window. Figure 4.4.1 below is an example of what the popup window looks like:

image::Ark_Popup_Window.PNG[width="600"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : Overdue Parcels Popup Window_

//end::overduePopup[]

== Parcel Fields

[#name]
=== Name Field: Name of Parcel Recipient

The Name field represents the name of the parcel's recipient. It can contain the name of the organisation or the person
 that you are delivering to the parcel to. +

[NOTE]
The Name field will only allow alphanumeric characters separated by whitespace. e.g. `John Doe`;
`8 Noodles at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa` +
Non-alphanumeric entries will be rejected by Ark. e.g. `John Doe!`

//tag::trackingNumber[]
[#tracking-number]
=== Tracking Number Field: Tracking Number of Parcel

The Tracking Number field represents the tracking number of the parcels.

This field allows you to add tracking numbers to your parcels. Tracking numbers allow you to keep track of the parcels
that are in your possession. This field is important because a single person can have many parcels belonging to
him. Hence, you can use our Tracking Number to differentiate between the different parcels that are allocated to a
single recipient. You can also use tracking numbers to identify specific parcels to be allocated

[NOTE]
Ark only supports tracking numbers for registered articles managed by SingPost at this instance. These
numbers include two `R`s followed by nine digits and ending with `SG`. e.g. `RR123456789SG` +
You can read more about SingPost Registered Article tracking number
 link:http://www.singpost.com/send-receive/sending-within-singapore/registered-article-local[here]. +
Tracking numbers that do not conform to the above format will be rejected e.g. `rr123545679sg`; `RR#12345678SG`;

[NOTE]
You can add multiple parcels with the same tracking number. This allows you to reuse tracking numbers in the event when
the number of parcels in your inventory exceeds the number of tracking numbers. There has been instances of this
occurring during festive seasons such as Christmas. +
The team is working on adding support for more types of tracking numbers such as those of
 link:https://www.ups.com/tracking/tracking.html[UPS] and link:https://www.fedex.com/sg/[FedEx] in the future. +
//end::trackingNumber[]

[#phone]
=== Phone Field: Phone of Parcel Recipient

The Phone field represents the phone number of the parcel's recipient. It can contain the phone number of the
organisation or the person that you are delivering to the parcel to. +

You can only assign a single phone number to a each parcel. You may omit this field in your entry, preferably only
when it is not provided. +

[NOTE]
The Phone field will only allow you to add phone numbers with 3 or more digits. e.g. `1234 5678`; `1122 2344 5678`; +
This is to allow you to add overseas numbers per the request of the parcel's recipient. +
Phone numbers shorter than 3 digits will be rejected. e.g. `4`, `12`; +

[#address]
=== Address Field: Destination Address of Parcel Delivery

The Address field represents the destination address of your parcel. This field contains the address that you should
deliver your parcel to.

[NOTE]
The Address field will only allow you to add an address with at least a single character as the text representation of
the address, and appended with a valid postal code, separated from the text representation of the address with space(s).
e.g. `123, example street #05-26 S012345`; +
Invalid address entries include the following: e.g. `123, example street #05-26`
You can learn more about valid postal code entries below. +

//tag::postalCode[]
[#postal-code]
==== Postal Code: Postal Code of Delivery Address of the Parcel

Ark can store the postal address of locations in Singapore. It only accepts values of `s` or `S` followed by 6 digits.
The postal code of a parcel is used to query Google Maps when the `select` command is executed or when a parcel in the
Parcel List Panel is clicked. Invalid values would include the following: `213661`; `s#11122`;

*Postal codes must be appended to the end of the address text.* e.g. Suppose you are adding a new parcel into Ark and
entered `add ...(Some info)... a/NUS School of Computing, COM1, 13 Computing Drive, S117417 ...(More info required
in the add command)...`. In this case, `S11417` is the postal code of the above address and is appended to its
respective address, separated by a space.

[WARNING]
If you did not append the postal code of the address at the end of your address, Ark will not recognize your address
input as a valid input and would give you an invalid input message.

[NOTE]
Presently, the `PostalCode` field still does a very relaxed validation and does not completely ensure that the postal
code exists even though it might meet the criteria above. The team is working on producing a database of postal codes
 in Singapore. In the meantime, we encourage users to take additional precautions when entering the postal codes
 into Ark and ensure that the postal code inputs are valid.
//end::postalCode[]

[#email]
=== Email Field: Email of Parcel Recipient

The Email field represents the email contact of the parcel's recipient. It can contain the email of the organisation
or the person that you are delivering to the parcel to.

[NOTE]
The Email field will only allow alphanumeric or periods characters separated by an `@` character. e.g. `John@example.com`
Invalid Email entries include the following: e.g. `John_Doe@example.com`; `JaneDoe.example.com`;

//tag::deliveryDate[]
[#delivery-date]
=== Due Date Field: Due Date for Parcel Delivery

`Delivery Date` is used to indicate the delivery date that the parcel must be delivered by.
The dates are only accepted if they are in the valid format DD-MM-YYYY or understandable by Ark.

Ark is able to recognise various forms of dates as shown in the table below but the dates in the Ark are formatted
as DD-MM-YYYY. However, invalid inputs such as a phone number or symbols still will be rejected.

Current date as of writing is 12 November 2017.

[#status]
=== Status Field: Delivery Status of Parcel

`Status` is used to indicate the current delivery status of a parcel. A parcel can have 4 possible delivery status and
listed below is a description of these `Status` values.

[width="100%",cols="20%,<80%",options="header",]

`Tag`s are used to indicate how the parcel should be handled. Tags can contain one or more of the following `Tag`s:

[width="100%",cols="20%,<80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Tag | Description
|FROZEN | This means the parcel should be refrigerated as its contents are temperature sensitive.
|FLAMMABLE | This means that the parcels' contents are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat.
|HEAVY | This indicates that the parcel is heavy and may require additional manpower to deliver.
|FRAGILE | This state indicates that the parcels' contents can be broken easily and requires additional care
when handling.

Trying to type in long commands can be quite a hassle. That is why Ark comes with tab autocompletion which is able to
help fill in commands as well as the prefixes for you without requiring you to fully type out the command
with the needed fields. Ark autocompletion is smart and knows exactly what field you need, all you have to do is press
kbd:[Tab] and let Ark handle the rest!

*Autocomplete for commands:* +
To make use of the autocomplete feature for commands, simply type in the first few letters of the command you want
to use:

_Figure 5.21.1 : Fill in the first few letters of the command you want to use. In this case, we want to use the `Add`
 command, so we enter `a` into the text field_

now press the kbd:[Tab] key: +

_Figure 5.21.2 : After kbd:[Tab] is pressed Ark will fill in the command for you_

Ark will then fill in the rest for you if there is a match.

If there is more than one possibility for the autocompletion, Ark will display the possible options to you as shown in the
below.

_Figure 5.21.3 : If there are multiple autocomplete options, the options will be displayed in the result window_

In this case, you can press tab to cycle through the different options available.

_Figure 5.21.4 : Pressing kbd:[Tab] again will cycle to the next matching command_

*Autocomplete for prefixes:* +
For commands that require prefixes, you can press kbd:[Tab] after filling in the command word. Ark will bring you to the
next missing prefix for you to fill in. After this, you can then press tab to cycle through the list of prefixes.

_Figure 5.21.5 : After filling in the command into the text field, pressing kbd:[Tab] will bring you
 to the first missing prefix_

image::autocompleteWithFullAddCommandAndOnePrefixCycle.PNG[width="400"]
_Figure 5.21.6 : Pressing kbd:[Tab] will cycle to the next missing prefix_

Alternatively, you can also enter the first letter of the prefix you want before you press kbd:[Tab] and Ark will fill
in the `/` character for you.

image::autocompleteWithFullAddCommandAndPartOfPrefix.PNG[width="400]
_Figure 5.21.7 : Fill in the command you want along with the first letter of the prefix you want_

image::autocompleteWithFullAddCommandAndOnePrefix.PNG[width="400"]
_Figure 5.21.8 : Pressing kbd:[Tab] append the `/` character for you_

After you have chosen the prefix you want, simply enter in the details as needed.

image::autocompleteWithFullAddCommandAndOnePrefixFilled.PNG[width="400"]
_Figure 5.21.9 : Fill in the needed details as per normal_

After you are done entering the needed details of the prefix, press kbd:[Tab] to move on to the next prefix. Note
that if your input ends with the first character of a prefix preceded by a space (e.g " n"),
you will need to press kbd:[Space] before you press kbd:[Tab] to get the outcome you want.

_Figure 5.21.10 : Pressing kbd:[Tab] will fill in the next missing prefix_

*Autocomplete for indexes:* +
For commands that require indexes, you can press kbd:[Tab] after filling in the command word. Ark will then
allow you to cycle through the indexes available by pressing kbd:[Tab]

image::autocompleteWithStartOfSelectCommand.PNG[width="400"]
_Figure 5.21.11 : After filling in the command into the text field, pressing kbd:[Tab] will bring you
 to the first available index_

image::autocompleteWithStartOfSelectCommandCycle.PNG[width="400"]
_Figure 5.21.12 : Pressing kbd:[Tab] will cycle to the next available index_

*Examples:*

* `a` + kbd:[Tab] (auto-completes with `add` in the command line input)
* `e` + kbd:[Tab] + kbd:[Tab] (cycles to `exit` command)
* `edit` + kbd:[Tab] + kbd:[Tab] (auto-completes with `edit 1` on the first tab and then cycles
 to `edit 2` on the second tab)
* `add` + kbd:[Tab] + kbd:[Tab] (auto-completes with `edit #/` on the first tab and then cycles
  to `edit n/` on the second tab)

=== Saving the data

Ark data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

//tag::backup[]

[#back-up]
=== Backing up the data

Ark data are backed up in the hard disk automatically at the start of every session of the program. +
There is no need to back up the data manually. +
The backup file is appended with `-backup.xml` and is stored in the same folder as the main storage file. +

To load the backup file into Ark, you can perform the following actions:

 1. Firstly, open the `/data/` folder in the home directory of Ark.
 2. Then, copy the backup file, and paste the copied file into your `/data/import` directory. i.e. `ark-backup.xml`
 3. Open the Ark Application. If Ark fails to start as a result of corrupted data in your Ark save file, simply delete
 the corrupted save file and restart the Ark application.
 4. Finally, import the backup save file into Ark by using the `import` command by typing `import (back-up file name)` .
 i.e. `import ark-backup.xml` +

Alternatively, you can delete your original save file and rename your backup file to the name of your original save
 file. However, this approach will result in data being loss if your original save file was not corrupted and contains
 valuable data.

[NOTE]
If Ark is unable to read your save file for reasons such as the save file being of an invalid format or if your save
file was missing (*gasp*), Ark would not create a backup file for you on start up. +

//end::backup[]

//tag::sortedList[]

=== Maintaining a Sorted List

The list of parcels stored in Ark is maintained to be sorted according to the delivery date of
the parcels, with the earliest delivery date at the top. This allows the more pertinent
deliveries to be shown quickly. +
The list is sorted whenever there is a change in the list that may potentially disrupt the order
of the list so that the user does not have to manually do so.

*A*: Please refer to the link:#tooltip[Parcel Tooltip section] .

*Q*: I want to add parcels from a save file on another computer to my own instance of Ark without having to overwrite
my own copy of Ark. How can I do this? +
*A*: Copy the save file on the other computer into your computer. Store this save file in the `/data/import` directory
 of your Ark application. Then launch the Ark application and import your the copied save file into Ark.
 Please refer to the link:#import[Import Command section] if you are unfamiliar with using the import command.
