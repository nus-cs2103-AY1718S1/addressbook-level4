=== 30-Second Tutorial

Let's get started. Here is a quick demonstration showing how to perform basic contact management with DeathNote.

image::usage.gif[width="768"]

Here is an explanation of what is happening. First, add 3 persons namely Alice, Bob and Carol.

....
> add n/Alice
New person added: Alice Remarks:

> add n/Bob
New person added: Bob Remarks:

> add n/Carol
New person added: Carol Remarks:
....

Intuitive. Now you want to find the information about Bob.

....
> find n/Bob
1 persons listed!
....

To view everyone in your DeathNote:

....
> list
Listed all persons
....

To remove the third person shown on the list from your DeathNote:

....
> delete 3
....

=== Command Line Syntax

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be replaced by the user. `add n/NAME` can be written as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. `n/NAME [p/PHONE]` can be written as both `n/John Doe p/93456635` and as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple (including zero) times. `[t/TAG]...` can be written as ``, `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`.
