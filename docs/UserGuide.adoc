.Command box
image::command-box.png[width="790"]

// tag::command-syntax[]
=== Breaking down the command syntax
Commands have the following format: `[red]#COMMAND_WORD# [blue]#-OPTION# [green]#PARAMETERS#` +

* The [red]`COMMAND_WORD` is the first word in the command
** It specifies *what you want to do*

* [blue]`OPTIONS` come after the [red]`COMMAND_WORD`
** They are prefixed with a dash (e.g. `-tag`)
** Provides more information on *how the action is to be performed*

* [green]`PARAMETERS` are the last segment of the command
** They provide the *information required to execute the action*

Example:

* `[red]#find# [blue]#-tag# [green]#friends#` can be understood as "[red]#find contacts# [blue]#with the tag# [green]#friends#"

// end::command-syntax[]

=== Representing a person as a parameter

When using commands that involve managing contact information, you may be required to enter information about a person as a `[blue]#PARAMETER#`.

Each person stored in the address book has the following attributes:

** Represented with the prefix `dp/` followed by the path to the image to be used as the person's display picture
** The specified image must be less than 1MB in size
** If no image is specified, the default image will be used instead

Example:

* The parameter `n/John Doe p/81234567 a/123 Clementi Road, Blk 32, #01-01 e/johndoe@example.com t/friends t/school s/facebook john.doe10 s/instagram jdoe f/ dp//images/display.png`

== Features

=== Understanding command formats
In this user guide, you will find information about how commands are to be used explained in the form of *command formats*.

These *command formats* will tell you what the [red]`COMMAND_WORD` for the command is, whether [blue]`OPTIONS` are available for the command,
and what [green]`PARAMETERS` you need to provide the command with.

[NOTE]
====
* Parameters in *square brackets* are optional
* Parameters followed by an ellipsis `...` can be repeated multiple times
* Parameters can be in any order
* Some commands have an alternative shorter alias that can be used in place of the [red]`COMMAND_WORD`
====

Example:

* `[red]#delete# [blue]#[-OPTION]# [green]#INDEX [ADDITIONAL_INDEXES]...#` means that:
** The [red]`COMMAND_WORD` is `delete`
