== Introduction

ConnectUs is a professional address book application tailored to small to medium enterprises
who wish for prompt lookup of their business partners particulars. It allows for storage and management of business contacts, quick and easy
access to their emails, and displays their location on Google Maps.

ConnectUs v1.2 is available for Windows and Mac OS X Operating Systems.

== About

This tutorial gives an overview on the basic functions of ConnectUs such as adding a contact, emailing a contact
and displaying their location on Google Maps. Being a very simple application, no prior technical knowledge is required to use this application.

Below lists the command terminology which would be used throughout this guide:
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
