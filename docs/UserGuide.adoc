== Introduction

Welcome to ModU, a time slot booking system for professors and administrators in tertiary institutions. +
ModU brings easy-to-use graphic user interface(GUI). With ModU, you can see time slots that are available.
You can also build your own timetable and manage them anytime. +
The command line interface(CLI) is the primary mode of input. We believe that when you can control ModU by typing,
many tasks can be performed more quickly and therefore save you loads of time.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ModU.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* *`module`* : lists all module
* *`add`* *`m/MA1101R ct/LEC v/LT27 gp/1 ts/FRI[1400-1600] l/ Ma Siu Lun`* : adds a lesson with module code `MA1101R` to the ModU list.
* *`sort`* : sort lesson shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add m/CODE`, `CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add m/MA1101R`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `m/NAME l/LECTURER [l/LECTURER]` can be used as `m/MA1101R l/Ma Siu Lun l/Victor Tan` or as `m/MA1101R l/Ma Siu Lun`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, at least one time e.g. `l/LECTURER [l/LECTURER]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 1 times), `l/Ma Siu Lun`, `l/Ma Siu Lun l/Victor Tan` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `gp/GROUP ts/TIME_SLOT ct/CLASS_TYPE`, `v/VENUE m/CODE` is also acceptable.

Format: `edit INDEX [m/MODULE_CODE] [ct/CLASS_TYPE] [v/VENUE] [gp/GROUP] [ts/TIME_SLOT] [l/Lecturer...]`

****
* Edits the lesson at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last lesson listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing lecturers, the existing lecturers of the lesson will be removed i.e adding of lecturers is not cumulative.
****

Edits an existing attribute(module/location) in the ModU list. +
Format: `edit INDEX [CODE/LOCATION]...`

****
* Edits the attribute at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last attribute listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

=== Locating lessons by module code: `find`

Finds lessons whose code match the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `MA1101R` will match `Ma1101r`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `MA1101R CS2101` will match `CS2101` and 'MA1101R'
* Only the code is searched.
* Only full module code will be matched e.g. `MA1101` will not match `MA1101R`
* Lessons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `MA1101R CS2101` will return `MA1101R` or `CS2101`
****

Examples:

* `find MA1101R` +
