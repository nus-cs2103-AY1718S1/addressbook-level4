== About

This developer guide provides developers working on the KayPoh! application an in-depth explanation
of how the application works. A working knowledge of UML diagram notation and familiarity with the Java programming
language will be helpful in understanding the implementation details discussed in this guide.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1: Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter`: This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter`: Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*]: The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*]: The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*]: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*]: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2: Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1: Structure of the UI Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1: Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1: Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1: Structure of the Model Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1: Structure of the Storage Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

_Figure 3.1.1: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

_Figure 3.1.2: Interactions inside Logic Component for the `undo` Command_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

_Figure 3.1.3: Flow of activities inside `UndoRedoStack`_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::multiplephonenumbers[]
=== Multiple Fields

When an `AddCommandParser` or `EditCommandParser` is used to parse a command, an `ArgumentMultimap` object is created which contains a hashmap mapping the prefixes to a list of their respective arguments.

The `ArgumentMultimap` class has a `getValue` method and a `getMultipleValues` method. If there are multiple strings passed as arguments to the prefix, the `getValue` method returns only the last string in the list, while the `getMultipleValues` returns a concatenation of all the strings in the list.

The `ParserUtil` class has various parsing methods, such as `parseName` and `parsePhone`. The method `parseName` returns a `Name` object wrapped in the `Optional` class and the method returns a `Phone` object wrapped in the `Optional` class.

The `parsePhone` method in the `ParserUtil` class calls the `getMultipleValues` method of the `ArgumentMultimap` class instead of the `getValue` method called by the other parsers. This allows multiple phone numbers to be stored in a `Phone` object.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Display of the multiple phone numbers +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Insert a newline character ("\n") between different phone numbers. +
**Pros:** Easier to see the different phone numbers. +
**Cons:** Less flexibility in adding multiple phone numbers (cannot type `p/12345 56789`). +
**Alternative 2:** Insert a space character (" ") between different phone numbers. +
**Pros:** More flexibility in adding multiple phone numbers. Can type type `p/12345 56789` to add the two phone numbers with only one "p/" prefix. +
**Cons:** Harder to see the different phone numbers, makes the display more cluttered. +

**Aspect:** Initialising of `Phone` object +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Constructor of `Phone` takes in a String as parameter, modify current constructor. +
**Pros:** No need to create a new method. +
**Cons:** Not so easy to manipulate the string and split the multiple phone numbers. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a new constructor for `Phone` that takes in a List<String> as parameter. +
**Pros:** Easier to manipulate the multiple phone numbers in the list. +
**Cons:** Can cause problems during testing as there are two constructors. +

**Aspect:** Allowing duplicate phone numbers for a contact +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do not allow duplicate phone numbers. +
**Pros:** Makes the address book more usable. +
**Cons:** Need to implement checking of the arguments. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow duplicate phone numbers. +
**Pros:** No need to check whether the arguments have been entered already. +
**Cons:** May cause the address book to be messy if adding duplicate phone numbers was not the user's intention. +

**Aspect:** Dealing with invalid values as well as valid values +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accept valid values and ignore invalid values. +
**Pros:** Makes it easier for the user as the invalid value may have been an accident and the valid value may actually be correct. +
**Cons:** Both values may have been incorrect and an incorrect phone number would have been added. +
**Alternative 2:** Ignore all values as long as there is one invalid value. +
**Pros:** No need to continue checking the rest of the arguments once there is one invalid value. +
**Cons:** The incorrect value may have been an accident and the user may want the valid value to be added as a phone number to the contact. +
// end::multiplephonenumbers[]

// tag::facebook[]
=== Facebook mechanism

The Facebook Commands are facilitated by the Facebook Graph API and utilised through the Facebook4j unofficial public API.
Facebook4j supports all facebook related features such as `facebookconnect` and `facebookpost`.

The Facebook Graph API first required us to set up a Facebook Application on the Facebook for developers website. We did so following this link:https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register/#create-app[`guide`].

Completing the creation led to a page as shown below:

.Facebook Application setup page
image::facebook_developers_app.png[width="800"]

Since our AddressBook application is, for now, hosted on a private environment and not a website, we need to authenticate `Testers` on the developers platform as follows:

.Facebook Application testers configuration page
image::facebook_dashboard_testers.png[width="800"]

The Facebook4j API requires us to build a Gradle dependency in the `gradle.properties` file:

----
compile group: 'org.facebook4j', name: 'facebook4j-core', version: '2.4.10'
----

Once the above have been set up, we need to attain a user access key from Facebook through a Facebook Login. This is done through a browser.

Once the access key has been attained, we then set the application credentials in the `facebook4j.properties` and `FacebookConnectCommand.java` files respectively as follows:

----
debug=true
oauth.appId=*************
oauth.appSecret=***********************
----

----
facebookInstance = new FacebookFactory().getInstance();
facebookInstance.setOAuthPermissions(commaSeparetedPermissions);
facebookInstance.setOAuthAccessToken(new AccessToken(accessToken, null));
----

Lastly, we simply post the status to Facebook through the authenticated `facebookInstance` using the following code:

----
Facebook facebookInstance = FacebookConnectCommand.getFacebookInstance();
facebookInstance.postStatusMessage(toPost);
----

The following diagram displays a summary of the entire process, using `facebookpost` as an example:

.Sequence diagram detailing execution of a `facebookpost` command
image::facebook_post_sequence_diagram.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Choice of Facebook API Wrapper (Java) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Facebook4j` wrapper +
**Pros:** User friendly API, well documented. +
**Cons:** Less available online support. +
**Alternative 2:**  Use `Restfb` wrapper +
**Pros:** Easily available online support. +
**Cons:** API is well documented, however less user friendly and functionalities compared to Facebook4j.

---

**Aspect:** How User is authenticated +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Manually login to Facebook using the browser +
**Pros:** Easier to implement given the intended environment of the application (private host rather than website) +
**Cons:** May not be authenticated to use a few Facebook API functions +
**Alternative 2:** Host the entire application on a website and attain Facebook approval. +
**Pros:** Have full access to most features and functions of Graph API +
**Cons:** As Facebook has a very strict criteria for all their applications, preparing the application for approval requires a lot of work that includes proper hosting, implementing SSH protection, having a privacy and terms document, etc.

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of Facebook commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each Facebook [COMMAND] is task oriented, e.g. Facebook connect, Facebook post, etc. +
**Pros:** Modular, all commands are separate and taken as blackbox although there are dependencies. +
**Cons:** Increase in possible dependencies in the software, like how most will depend on `Facebook connect`. +
**Alternative 2:** Ensure each command is stand-alone and fully independent +
**Pros:** Will have less dependencies. +
**Cons:** May incur more code overhead and make the software less 'lean'. +

// end::facebook[]

// tag::social-media-accounts[]
=== Social Media Accounts

Information about contact's social media accounts are encapsulated by the `SocialInfo` class. The list of `SocialInfos` associated
with a `Person` is handled by the `UniqueSocialInfoList`, which guarantees that at most one of each type of social media type is
associated with the contact.

The following class diagram represents the relationship between the `Person`, `UniqueSocialInfoList` and `SocialInfo` classes:

.Class diagram representing relationships between Person, UniqueSocialInfoList and SocialInfo classes
image::SocialInfoClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Parsing inputs representing social media accounts

The form `SOCIAL_TYPE_IDENTIFIER USERNAME` is used to represent a `SocialInfo` as a parameter in a CLI command.
The `SocialInfoMapping` class handles the mapping between the input `SOCIAL_TYPE_IDENTIFER` and the url format of the associated social media platform.
A `Collection` of these raw social info parameters can be passed to the `parseSocialInfo` method in the `SocialInfoMapping` class for parsing.

The following sequence diagram shows how input `rawSocialInfos` are parsed to obtain the appropriate `SocialInfos`:

.Sequence diagram detailing how inputs are parsed to form SocialInfos
image::ParseSocialInfoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
As far as possible instantiation of new `SocialInfo` classes should be handled by the `SocialInfoMapping` class.
The url structures for social media platforms are an external dependency that we do not have control over, thus it is
inevitable that some issues will inevitably arise due to changes in these external dependencies.
It is hence essential to isolate the logic pertaining to the generation of these urls so that any issues can easily be identified and resolved.

==== Adding support for new social media platforms

Handling for parsing inputs for new social platforms should be done by adding the following methods to the `SocialInfoMapping` class.

[source,java]
----
// The input parameter has been split into two parts - the socialType and the username

private static boolean isPlatformInfo(String[] splitRawSocialInfo) {
       // ... Check if the platform is identified by the input social info
    }

private static SocialInfo buildPlatformInfo(String[] splitRawSocialInfo) {
    // ... Parse the url representing the social media feed using the platform and username
    // ... Instantiate the SocialInfo represented by the platform, username, and url
}
----

and then adding the following logic to the `parseSocialInfos` method:

[source,java]
----
public static SocialInfo parseSocialInfo(String rawSocialInfo) throws IllegalValueException {
    // ... initialization logic here

    if (isFacebookInfo(splitRawSocialInfo)) {
        return buildFacebookInfo(splitRawSocialInfo);
    }

    // ... other social platforms here

    } else if (isPlatformInfo(splitRawSocialInfo)) {
        return buildPlatformInfo(splitRawSocialInfo);
    }

    // ... other social platforms here

    } else {
        throw new IllegalValueException(UNRECOGNIZED_SOCIAL_TYPE_MESSAGE);
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `SocialInfo` class +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Have a class that handles information for all social media platforms. +
**Pros:** Simple schema that is easily marshalled/unmarshalled by the JAXB library used by the storage component. +
**Cons:** Assumes that all social media platforms can be represented by the username and the url to the user's page.
Can be difficult to extend to contain more attributes for social platforms that may need them. +
**Alternative 2:** Have an abstract class that handles must-have information for all social media platforms,
which classes designed for each social platform will extend. +
**Pros:** More flexibility in extending the class to suit the needs of social media types. +
**Cons:** Difficult to handle marshalling/unmarshalling to XML format using the JAXB library.
Adds significant complexity to the codebase when number of supported platforms grow. +
**Additional Info:** An assessment of the major social media platforms shows that the username is sufficient to identify
users on all the major platforms at present. The first alternative was thus selected to ensure complexity of the codebase
remains manageable as support for more social media platforms is added.

---

**Aspect:** Detection of duplicate social types in `UniqueSocialInfoList` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Upon every addition of a `SocialInfo` to the list, iterate through each element in the
existing list to ensure that there are no duplicates. +
**Pros:** No delay on startup. Computation is performed only on demand. +
**Cons:** Slight delay may occur upon every operation that involves addition of a `SocialInfo` to a `UniqueSocialInfoList`
if the number of social platforms supported is high. +
**Alternative 2:** Precompute the HashSet for every `UniqueSocialInfoList` which contains the social types of each `SocialInfo` in the list
upon loading from data file. +
**Pros:** No delay on addition of a `SocialInfo` to a `UniqueSocialInfoList`. +
**Cons:** Possible delay when starting up the application if number of contacts or number of social platforms supported is high.
Additional space required to support storing the HashSets in memory. +
**Additional Info:** Number of social platforms is expected to be a reasonable amount, and thus should not cause much noticable delay.
In comparison, the startup delay may be more significant when a large number of contacts are present in the address book. Thus the first
alternative was selected to provide a more pleasant user experience.
// end::social-media-accounts[]

// tag::command-syntax[]
[[command-options]]
=== Command Options

As some functionalities have similar behaviours, we group them under a single `COMMAND_WORD` and allow the user to include
`OPTIONS` when using the command to specify which functionality is to be executed.

The following command syntax is thus adopted: `COMMAND_WORD [-OPTIONS]... [PARAMETERS]...`, where:

* The `COMMAND_WORD` specifies the *action to be performed*,
* `OPTIONS` are prefixed with a dash (e.g. `-tag`) and specifies *how the action is to be performed*, and
* `PARAMETERS` provide *information for the action to be executed with*.

==== Handling Options

Arguments that may include options should be wrapped with the `OptionBearingArgument` class, which abstracts the parsing
of options and parameters. The following code snippet shows how the `OptionBearingArgument` may be used to parse user inputs:

[source,java]
----
// assume that args is a string containing user input with both arguments and parameters
OptionBearingArgument opArg = new OptionBearingArgument(args);
// options are returned in the form of a set which contains options that are present in the argument
Set<String> options = opArg.getOptions();
// the options are stripped from the argument to give us the parameters
String parameters = opArg.getFilteredArgs();
----

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How commands with similar behaviour should be handled +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Group these commands under a single `COMMAND_WORD` and introduce a new `OPTIONS` syntax
to allow the user to specify the desired functionality to be executed. +
**Pros:** Clear distinction between arguments that specify how a command should be executed, and arguments that provide information
for the command to be executed with. +
**Cons:** Potentially more initial confusion for the user as there is an additional syntax to learn. To mitigate this a
section explaining the updated command syntax has been added to the user guide. +
**Alternative 2:** Group these commands under a single `COMMAND_WORD`, and use the existing `PREFIX/` syntax to identify
how a command should be executed. +
**Pros:** User does not need to learn additional syntax. +
**Cons:** The meaning of the `PREFIX/` syntax becomes unintuitive. This syntax is currently used to denote a property
in an object (i.e. `p/` denotes a phone number in a person). To extend this syntax to command modifiers makes it confusing
for the user as the meaning of the syntax becomes diluted. An informal survey conducted with our target users confirms
that this approach was less intuitive to them compared to the approach described in Alternative 1. +
**Alternative 3:** Have separate `COMMAND_WORDS` for each command. +
**Pros:** Simple syntax, with no confusion over what behaviour will be executed. +
**Cons:** Does not scale well as users have to remember many different commands as the number of features grow.

// end::command-syntax[]

=== Favorite Contacts

The favorite status of each contact is stored as a `boolean`, encapsulated within the `Favorite` class. +
There are several ways to toggle this `boolean` to change the favorite status of a contact.

==== Toggle favorites using `add` and/or `edit` command +
For user's convenience, we are allowing just the input of prefixes i.e. `f/` in `add` command and either `f/` or `uf/` in `edit` command to make a change to a contact's favorite status.

As such, at `Parser` level in both `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser`, we simply need to know whether the prefixes are present in the user input. Prefixes in user input can be found in `ArgumentMultimap argMultimap`. Hence, we can utilise the following helper-method by passing in `PREFIX_FAV` or `PREFIX_UNFAV` to return true if the prefix is contained within the user input, false otherwise:
[source,java]
----
public boolean isPrefixPresent(Prefix prefix) {
    return argMultimap.containsKey(prefix);
}
----

The helper-method above is called within a common method `parseFavorite` (shown below), used by both `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` classes. The difference in utilisation of the following method by both classes is in the parameters that are passed in. As `AddCommandParser` only needs to check whether `PREFIX_FAV` exists, it will pass in `parseFavorite(argMultimap, PREFIX_FAV, null)` while `EditCommandParser` will pass in `parseFavorite(argMultimap, PREFIX_FAV, PREFIX_UNFAV)` to check for both prefixes.
[source,java]
----
public static Optional<Favorite> parseFavorite(ArgumentMultimap argMultimap,
                                     Prefix prefixFav,
                                     Prefix prefixUnFav) throws ParseException {
    // ... parser logic ...
}
----

For editing person, after obtaining the presence of prefix in user input, we need to perform some input validation by disallowing both `f/` and `uf/` prefixes to be present at the same time. We can check this by using the he:
[source,java]
----
    // Disallow both f/ and uf/ to be present in the same instance of user input when editing
    if (argMultimap.isPrefixPresent(prefixFav) && argMultimap.isPrefixPresent(prefixUnFav)) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
                            EditCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
----

For both adding and editing person, there is a similar validation for disallowing text after prefix e.g. `f/this is a text`. This is achieved by checking whether the any additional `String` exists after prefix.
[source,java]
----
    if (argMultimap.isPrefixPresent(prefixFav)) {
        if (!argMultimap.getValue(prefixFav).get().isEmpty()) { // Disallow text after prefix
            throw new ParseException(Favorite.MESSAGE_FAVORITE_CONSTRAINTS);
        } else {
            return Optional.of(new Favorite(true));
        }
    }
----

==== Toggle favorites using `fav` and/or `unfav` command

To enhance contact management, we implemented these commands to perform batch favoriting or unfavoriting of multiple contacts. They are also capable of performing the operations on a single contact. The implementation involves two major steps.

The first step to doing so is to allow parsing of multiple indexes so that a user could specify which contacts they would like to favorite or unfavorite i.e. `fav 1 2 3`. In this case, we use `List` to parse and store every index.
[source,java]
----
public static List<Index> parseMultipleIndexes(String args) throws IllegalValueException {
    List<String> argsList = Arrays.asList(args.trim().split("\\s+"));
    List<Index> indexList = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String index : argsList) {
        indexList.add(parseIndex(index));
    }
    return indexList;
}
----
Note that trimming `args.trim()` is required since the args passed will usually contain a leading whitespace. The regex `args.trim().split("\\s+")` is used as a form of validation to ignore multiple trailing whitespaces and still allowing such user input to be parsed, preventing an `exception`.

The last step is to create a copy of the person we are favoriting or unfavoriting and change its favorite status via the aforementioned `boolean`. Since the `Person` class takes two constructors, the following constructor allows creating a copy of a given `ReadOnlyPerson`.
[source,java]
----
public Person(ReadOnlyPerson source) {
    // ... create copy of all fields ...
}
----
After getting the copy of the person e.g. `personToFavorite`, it is easy to call `personToFavorite.setFavorite(new Favorite(true))` and that sets the person as a favorite. Batch operation of favoriting or unfavoriting multiple contacts simply loops this last step for the amount of indexes specified by the user.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storing of favorite status +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store it as a `boolean` +
**Pros:** Saves memory, more efficient to call `isFavorite()` to check whether a person is a favorite contact +
**Cons:** Unable to check for `null` or use any other values apart from `true` or `false` +
**Alternative 2:** Store it as a `String` +
**Pros:** Easier for printing its values +
**Cons:** Requires input validation for `String`, less efficient in checking whether a person is a favorite contact (`O(N)` in the worse case scenario)

**Aspect:** Ways to change the favorite status of a person +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allowing favoriting and unfavoriting of contacts through adding and editing persons as well as through `fav` and `unfav` commands +
**Pros:** Creates a more consistent workflow for our user that ties in with other fields, a more straight-foward approach to indicate which are the favorite contacts upon adding a person +
**Cons:** More tedious implementation +
**Alternative 2:** Just rely on `fav` and `unfav` commands +
**Pros:** Easier implementation +
**Cons:** User would have to remember more commands and their usages

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting Contacts
To make it easier for users to find contacts, the displayed person list is kept sorted. Users can specify how contacts
are to be ordered in the list using the `sort` command.

The sorting logic makes use of the Observer pattern. Instead of keeping the `personList` itself sorted, a `SortedList`
backed by the `personList` is constructed. The `SortedList` keeps a list of persons equivalent to that of the `personList`
in sorted order, and ensures that it remains sorted even as changes are made to the underlying `personList`.

This `SortedList` is in turn observed by the `FilteredList` to ensure that the list remains in sorted order even as filters are applied.

The above relationship is represented by the following class diagram:

.Class diagram representing the Observer pattern used to keep contacts in sorted order
image::SortObserverClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

KayPoh! allows the user to sort the person list in several ways. To prevent the user from having to remember a separate
`COMMAND_WORD` for each of these sort commands, we allow these sort commands to share a single `COMMAND_WORD` by having them
inherit from an abstract `SortCommand` class, and introducing <<command-options, Command Options>> to allow the user to specify the sorting order
to be used instead.

.Class diagram representing how the `sort` commands are implemented
image::SortCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Each class that inherits from the `SortCommand` would then implement the `getComparator` method, which returns a
`Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>` to be used by the parent `SortCommand` to define the ordering for the `SortedList`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Where sorting should be handled +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Handle sorts at the `ModelManager` level using the Observer pattern +
**Pros:** Sorting is performed on an in-memory list decoupled from the data file, and hence does not require IO operations which are
computationally more expensive compared to in-memory operations. +
**Cons:** Slightly longer startup time might be observed as the data file is not sorted and hence has to be sorted upon every startup. +
**Alternative 2:** Handle sorts at the `AddressBook` level by sorting the `personList` directly +
**Pros:** Startup might be faster as the data file should have already been sorted. Also reduces complexity of the `Model`
as there is no need to maintain any additional data structures. +
**Cons:** As the `personList` is supposed to mirror the data file, every sort operation will involve updating the data file
in order to keep it in sync with the `personList`. This requires IO operations that are slower compared
to in-memory operations.

---

**Aspect:** How to implement different `sort` commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have an abstract `SortCommand` class with an abstract `getComparator` function to
allow the inheriting classes to define the `Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>` to be used to sort the displayed person list. +
**Pros:** Significantly reduces code duplication, and makes introducing new `sort` commands easy. +
**Cons:** Assumes that all `sort` commands will have similar behavior, differing only in the `Comparator` used for sorting. +
**Alternative 2:**  Have separate commands for each `sort` command. +
**Pros:** More flexibility in how each `sort` command is implemented should requirements change in the future. +
**Cons:** If `sort` commands have similar behavior, then there will be significant amounts of code duplication. +
// end::sort[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE`: Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
