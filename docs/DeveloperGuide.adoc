== Welcome to Contact Plus
Contact Plus is a contact-managing service through command line. We strive to provide the very comprehensive services for busy students on the campus so that they can manage their contacts efficiently. For example, the auto-correction feature allows
our busy friend - David, a university student, to type fast on the keyboard without worrying spelling mistakes.

To make Contact Plus better, there are many ways for you to contribute to this project: coding for new features, testing, integrating with third party APIs, or simply contributing to the documentations.
This guide will not only help you get started as a Contact Plus contributor, but that you will find useful even though you are an experienced contributor.


== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Undo/Redo Mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +

=== AutoCorrect Mechanism

The `AutoCorrect` feature enables misspelt commands entered by users to be autoCorrected by the application,
and perform the correct command. The correction of the misspelt command is based on four types of prediction of the misspelt words, namely, addition of alphabets, deletion
of alphabets, transposing of alphabets and Substitution of alphabets. For the sake of efficiency, the link:#edit-distance[edit distance] is limited to 2 (refer to `editDistance1`, and `checkMisspeltWords`).

This is an example of how the misspelt words are predicted by adding one more alphabet:
[source,java]
----
//Adding any one character (from the alphabet) anywhere in the word.
        for (int i = 0; i <= formattedWord.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < alphabet.length(); j++) {
                String newWord = formattedWord.substring(0, i) + alphabet.charAt(j)
                        + formattedWord.substring(i, formattedWord.length());
                results.add(newWord);
            }
        }
----

Auto-Correct is only utilized in `AddressBoonParser` class to check each input command, and correct the misspelt command which has an link:#edit-distance[edit distance] smaller than or equal to 2.
The following diagram shows the interaction between `AutoCorrect` and `AddressBookParser` class:

image::AddressBookParser.SequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `COMMAND_WORD` for every available command must be added to the `getCommandPool` method for the command to be auto-corrected.
* AutoCorrect will only work for misspelt words within link:#edit-distance[edit distance] of 2.
* AutoCorrect is based on four types of prediction of misspelt words, namely, addition, deletion, switch, and substitution.
* Alias will not be autoCorrected as it consists only one or two alphabets.
* The logic for autoCorrecting commands is implemented in AutoCorrectCommand class.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Implementation of `AutoCorrect` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Consider edit distance is 2 and the command is predicted based on the first alphabet. +
**Pros:** The speed of searching is improved by implementing matching command by the first alphabet as the first alphabet entered by users is often correct.
Edit distance 2 allows a considerable number of commands to be corrected by the application. +
**Cons:** The prediction by first alphabet limits the autoCorrection on those commands that have first alphabet wrong.
Edit distance 2 does not cover many other misspelt commands. +

**Alternative 2:** Read all the available file from an external file when the application begins. +
**Pros:** It would be easier for developers to maintain the autoCorrect feature as it is easier to update new commands into a file rather than in a method. +
**Cons:** It would not be able to utilise `COMMAND_WORD` defined in each command class
as it is a good practice to reused what is already defined and extend its usage (Close to modification and Open to extension Principle). +

=== Yahoo Weather Display Mechanism
The Yahoo weather information display is aided by the external library "yahoo-weather-java-api:2.0.2". This library queries data from Yahoo Weather API, and the application display the information returned by calling the library functions with
a simple string parser method to format the data return. The formatted data is displayed on the `StatusFooterBar`. +

The query of weather information is closely related to the location. The location is specified by WOEID, so in this application we take the link:#WOEID[WOEID] of Singapore by default. +

[source,java]
----
private final String woeid = "1062617";
----

The API method is called, and data returned as follows:

[source,java]
----
YahooWeatherService service = new YahooWeatherService();
Channel channel = service.getForecast(woeid, DegreeUnit.CELSIUS);

return conditionStringParser(channel.getItem().getCondition().toString());
----

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* This feature has a strong dependency on Yahoo Weather Server. Some exceptions or assertions should be implemented to prevent the failure of the application
due to the failure of Yahoo Weather Server. +

=== Alias for command Mechanism[[alias-for-command]]

Alias in this application is a single alphabet or two alphabets. This purpose of alias is to save the labor of typing the full corresponding command words, therefore it is more efficient and easier to use.
The alias mechanism is implemented in `AddressBookParser`, and its logic can be described by the following activity diagram:

image:AliasActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

1. `AddressBookParser` receives the input argument from users. +
2. If the input argument is an alias, the corresponding command instance is created and command is processed. +
3. If the input argument is a command word, the command instance is created, and the command is processed.

The code snippet is shown as follows:
[source,java]
----
case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD: case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD_ALIAS:
            return new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments);
----

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Length of an alias +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one or two alphabets to represent a command, usually it is the first alphabet of its corresponding command word. +
**Pros:** Easy to memories the alias as it is the first letter of the command word. +
**Cons:** May be confusing when some command requires two alphabets for alias. This is because there will be overlapping alias when two command words have the same first letter. +

**Alternative 2:** Use a fixed length of three alphabets for every alias. +
**Pros:** The length for each alias is unformed. +
**Cons:** Three alphabets would be too long for commands like `add`. +

=== Autocomplete Mechanism[[autocomplete-feature]]

//tag::autocomplete-mechanism[]

The `autocomplete` feature is implemented in `AutoCompleteUtil` class. It enables commands to be automatically suggested and
completed for users. For example, when the user types, "sea", and press kbd:[TAB] key, the complete command `search` appears on the command line. This feature saves time for users and improves the efficiency of the application in general.
It is invoked in subclasses of `Logic` (e.g. `LogicManager`).

The interaction between `AutoCompleteUtil` and `Logic` classes can be seen from the following sequence diagram:

image::AutoCompleteCommand.sequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

As seen in the sequence diagram, `Logic` will get a list of all available commands from the `AutoCompleteUtil` class. Thereafter, it will pass
this list, together with the user's input string, to the `autoCompleteCommand()` method in the `AutoCompleteUtil` class, which will
generate and return a list of suggested commands.

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies [[autocomplete-dependencies]]

* The hotkey for launching `autocomplete` is indicated in the `CommandBox` class.
Currently, the hotkey is kbd:[TAB].
* The `COMMAND_WORD` field must exist in the class file representing each command.
* The `COMMAND_WORD` field in each command class is defined as the string that is used to invoke
that command.
For example, "add" is the `COMMAND_WORD` in the `AddCommand` class and is used to invoke the `add` operation.
* The `COMMAND_WORD` for every command must be added to
the `mapOfAvailableCommands` map in the  `Command` class.
If the developer forgets to perform this step, `AddressBook` will work
normally but there will be no hints for those commands.
* Although `autocomplete` currently does not support autocompletion
for aliases. The `COMMAND_WORD_ALIAS` alias for every command, that has an alias,
should be added to the `listOfCommandAliases` list in the `Command` class
for completeness and testing purposes.
* The logic for filtering matching commands is implemented in the `AutoCompleteUtil`
class. This is shown in the following code snippet:

image::AutoCompleteCommand.png[width="800"]

* If the need arises to autocomplete other fields such as `name`, `address` and `email`,
another method should be implemented in the `AutoCompleteUtil` class.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `autocomplete`. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a list of names of available commands to `Command` class. +
**Pros:** We do not need to care about how `autocomplete` works when adding new commands. We simply need to add the
 `COMMAND_WORD` of new commands to the Command class and `autocomplete` will automatically use them for hints.
 Furthermore, command names can be dynamically obtained via the `COMMAND_WORD` field for every command. +
**Cons:** Additional level of dependency as the developer has to consistently update the `Command` class whenever
 a new type of command is created. +

**Alternative 2:** Place the `COMMAND_WORD` of all commands into a text file and read it when `AddressBook` starts. +
**Pros:** No additional dependency among classes as `AddressBook` gets all command names from a text file rather
 than obtaining them from the `COMMAND_WORD` field of each type of command. +
**Cons:** The developer has to add the `COMMAND_WORD` of every new command to the text file.
 Furthermore, there is repeated work (and higher risk of error) as the developer must take care to ensure that the text file's entry corresponds with the
`COMMAND_WORD` field.

//end::autocomplete-mechanism[]

=== Extended Autocomplete Mechanism[[extended-autocomplete-feature]]

//tag::extended-autocomplete-mechanism[]

The `extended autocomplete` feature is an add-on to the `autocomplete` feature
and enables the full format of commands to be automatically filled into the command bar.
It is invoked in the `LogicManager` class.

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The hotkey for launching `extended autocomplete` is indicated in the `CommandBox` class.
Currently, the hotkey is kbd:[Ctrl]. The following excerpt briefly shows how the `autocomplete` string
is determined based on the `Command` entered by the user.

image::extended-autocomplete-snippet.png[width="800"]

* The `COMMAND_WORD` and `AUTOCOMPLETE_FORMAT` fields must exist in all class files that represent commands.
* For definition of `COMMAND_WORD`, see <<autocomplete-dependencies, this>>
* The `AUTOCOMPLETE_FORMAT` field is defined as a string that contains the format of the command that is represented by the enclosing class.
For example, if `test` command has the format of `test positive_integer` then `AUTOCOMPLETE_FORMAT` must be defined as
`test positive_integer` in the `TestCommand` class.
* The `mapOfAvailableCommands` map in the `Command` class must contain `<command_class.COMMAND_WORD, command_class.AUTCOMPLETE_FORMAT>`
as `<key, value>` pairs. An example of such a pair is `<AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD, AddCommand.AUTOCOMPLETE_FORMAT>`.
* If the developer forgets to perform the above step, `AddressBook` will work
normally but there will be no completion for those commands.
* `extended autocomplete` currently does not support autocompletion
for aliases.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `extended autocomplete`. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a shortcut key to launch `extended autocomplete` when a valid `COMMAND NAME`
has been typed into the command bar. +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement as we simply need to return a string based on the immediate user input. Furthermore, the `autocomplete` feature
complements this by enabling users to easily input a correct `COMMAND_NAME`. +
**Cons:** The user cannot choose from the list of suggestions by `Autocomplete`. He still has to type/autofill a
single command name first before being able to use the shortcut for `extended autocomplete`. +

**Alternative 2:** Allocate shortcut keys to select non-negative integers 0, 1, 2, 3 ... Each integer will be used as an
index to select a specific command from the `autocomplete` list of suggestions. +
Pros: Convenient for user to input any command as he only has to type its prefix partially before using `autocomplete` and
select the desired command using the shortcut for `extended autocomplete`. +
Cons: Finite number of keys on the keyboard make it impossible to do a one-to-one mapping of shortcut keys to commands.
 Furthermore, it is quite tricky to implement as using keys with printable characters will result in extra characters
 being printed together with the string returned by `extended autocomplete`.

//end::extended-autocomplete-mechanism[]

=== Delete Tag Mechanism

//tag::deletetag-mechanism[]

This mechanism is modelled by the `DeleteTagCommand` class. An instance of
`DeleteTagCommand` is created by the `AddressBookParser` class when the
user attempts to delete tags. The following sequence diagram shows the process from the
moment the user enters the `deletetag` command until the remaining tags
are displayed in the interface of `Contact Plus`.

image::DeleteTagCommand-sequence-diagram.png[width="800"]

The following code snippet shows how the `DeleteTagCommand` class
handles the user input - if there is no tag with the specified name, then
an error message is shown instead of a success message.

image::deletetag-snippet.png[]


==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `deleteTag()` method in model must be able to accept a `Tag` as input and
delete it from the address book.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `deletetag()` command. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete the specified tag from all contacts in the address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** If the user wishes to only remove that tag from one particular person. He has to re-add the tag
to every person who had that tag previously (except the one from which he wanted to remove the tag).

**Alternative 2:** Enable the user to choose several contacts from which he/she wishes to delete the tag. +
**Pros:** User has more control over which users to remove the tag from. Hence, this implementation removes
 the problem from alternative 1. +
**Cons:** Implementation is more complex as contacts have to be validated before handling the tag names.

//end::deletetag-mechanism[]

=== Locating groups by tag Mechanism

The main logic for this mechanism lies in the class `NameWithTagContainsKeywordsPredicate.java`. This class compares the lists of tags from each person, and compare the list of tag with the set of tags given by users.
This class makes uses of the powerful function from stream. The logic follow can be demonstrated by using the following activity diagram:

image:SearchTagActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following code snippet shows the main logic in `NameWithTagContainsKeywordsPredicate.java`:

[source,java]
----
@Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        Set<String> tagList = new HashSet<>();
        for (Tag tag : person.getTags()) {
            tagList.add(tag.getTagName());
        }

        return keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(tagList::contains);
    }
----
==== Prerequisites/Dependencies
* The tag name entered by users must be valid, i.e. exist in Contact Plus for the command to work successfully, else error message will be popped out.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Number of tags allowed to be specified by users. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow multiple tags to be entered by users
**Pros:** Increases the flexibility of this search by tag feature. There would be no restriction on the number of tags to be entered. Users can specify as many valid tags as they want to.
**Cons:** May not be obvious to users that they can enter multiple tag names.

**Alternative 2:** Only allow users to search one tag name at a time
**Pros:** The feature may looks simpler.
**Cons:** Adds limitation to what users can do.


=== Multiple Filter Mechanism

//tag::multifilter-mechanism[]

This mechanism is modelled by the `MultiFilterCommand` class. An instance of
`MultiFilterCommand` is created by the `AddressBookParser` class.
The following sequence diagram shows the process from the
moment the user enters the `multifilter` command until the results
are displayed in the interface of `Contact Plus`.

image::MultiFilterCommand-sequence-diagram.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `clearFiltersOnPersonList()` method in the `Model` class must clear all filters
in the filtered list of persons (i.e. show all elements in the list).
* The `updateFilteredPersonList()` method in the `Model` class must accept a `Predicate` as
input and apply it on the filtered list of persons (i.e. the list will only show
elements that match the condition specified by the given `Predicate`).

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `multifilter` command. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow the user to enter any number of filter fields (e.g. name, email, address, etc.) in any order. +
**Pros:** The user does not have to type unnecessary information (e.g. he/she does not have to specify a blank email if he/she just wants
to find a contact with a particular name). +
**Cons:** Technically difficult to implement as missing filter fields have to be detected and handled appropriately.

**Alternative 2:** Only allow the user to filter by one criteria in a single command. E.g.
If the user wishes to filter by name and address, he/she has to filter by name then
by address (using 2 commands). +
**Pros:** Very easy to implement as there is only one filter field to handle. +
**Cons:** Requires multiple steps, which could be irritating and non-intuitive to the user.

//end::multifilter-mechanism[]

=== Delete Multiple Contacts Mechanism
//tag::deletemultiple[]
The `Delete` multiple contacts feature enables user to delete more than one contact in a single command by specifying more than one indices. It is
invoked in the `DeleteCommand` class. +
The interaction between `Model` and `Logic` classes can be seen from the following sequence diagram:

image::DeleteMultiple/DeleteMultipleUML.PNG[width="800"]

The source code below shows the implementation of how multiple persons are deleted by using a loop:
[source,java]
----
for (Index i : targetIndex) {
            if (i.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
            }
        }

        String result = "";
        Collections.sort(targetIndex);
        for (Index i : targetIndex) {
            ReadOnlyPerson personToDelete = lastShownList.get(i.getZeroBased());

            try {
                model.deletePerson(personToDelete);
                if (targetIndex.size() == 1) {
                    result = result.concat(personToDelete.toString());
                } else {
                    result = result.concat("\n" + personToDelete.toString());
                }
            } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
                assert false : "The target person cannot be missing";
            }

        }
----

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `Index` to be deleted is added to an ArrayList of `Index`.
* To identify different `Index`, Regex `/` is used.
* ArrayList `Index` needs to be sorted in descending order to prevent IndexOutOfBound
exception.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `delete` Multiple Contact +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add the `Index` to be deleted to an ArrayList. +
**Pros:** We do not need to care how many `Index` or the order of the `Index` being input by the user as long as it
is separated by `/`. +
**Cons:** Additional space is required for the ArrayList of `Index`. +

**Alternative 2:** Use 'Lazy' delete by adding a boolean field to each element +
**Pros:** We do not need to remove anything from the ArrayList. The boolean 0 or 1 will just
indicate if the contact has been deleted. +
**Cons:** The whole List has to be iterated to check if the contact has been deleted.
//end::deletemultiple[]

=== Tab Switching Mechanism
//tag::tabswitch[]
The tab pane will switch between `Task` and `Map` based on the command entered by the user. If the
 Command input is related to the `person` model, it will be switched to the `Map` tab. Likewise, if the
 Command input is related to the `task` model, it will be switched to the `task` tab. +
The interaction between `Ui` and `Logic` classes can be seen from the following sequence diagram:

image::SwitchTab.png[width="800"]

The source code shows how the Command input is checked and how the tab is switched:
[source,java]
----
private void displayTab(String commandTyped) {
        Map<String, String> commandFormatMap = Command.getMapOfCommandFormats();
        List listOfAliases = Command.getListOfAvailableCommandAliases();
        int index = tabPane.getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndex();
        if (commandFormatMap.containsKey(commandTyped) || listOfAliases.contains(commandTyped)) {
            if (index != 0) {
                tabPane.getSelectionModel().selectFirst();
            }
        } else {
            tabPane.getSelectionModel().selectLast();
        }

    }
----
==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `task` Commands and `Person` Commands needs to be stored in different hashmap in
the `Command` class.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of Switch Tab mechanism +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Checks the command typed by user to the hashmap of available commands
 in `Command` class which are classified into `task` commands and `Person` commands. +
**Pros:** Simple if-else case as the commands are stored in two different hashmaps. +
**Cons:** Additional space is required for two different hashmaps. +
//end::tabswitch[]


=== Keyboard Shortcut Mechanism
The detection of keyboard shortcut is detected in the `CommandBox.java` class. In the method `handleKeyPress`, multiple key press situations are listed there and to handle the correct key pressed by users.
The code snippet is shown as follows:

[source,java]
----
// Handles cases where multiple keys are pressed simultaneously
        String getAlphabetPressed = keyEvent.getCode().toString();
        logger.info(getAlphabetPressed);

        if (keyEvent.getCode().isLetterKey() && keyEvent.isControlDown()) {
            //keyboard shortcut for input text heavy command
            switch (getAlphabetPressed) {
            case "A":
                keyEvent.consume();
                commandTextField.setText(AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD);
                break;
            case "D":
                keyEvent.consume();
                commandTextField.setText(DeleteCommand.COMMAND_WORD);
                break;
             ....
             //and many other cases
             default:
                  //do nothing
            }
        }
----

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Implementation of Keyborad shortcuts +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only a few commands have its keyboard shortcuts. +
**Pros:** Allow users to complete their input command faster by directly pressing the shortcuts. +
**Cons:** For some commands, users are not allowed to use keyboard shortcuts This is inconvenient. +

**Alternative 2:** Give every command its keyboard shortcuts. +
**Pros:**  Users can use shortcut for every command freely. +
**Cons:** It would be confusing to have to memorise many shortcuts.

// tag::themeselect[]
=== Theme Selection Mechanism

The 'theme support' feature allows user to choose their favorite theme for the address book, other than the default
Dark Theme. It is facilitated by `SwitchThemeCommand` class.

Currently, Contact Plus is presented with three themes: **Dark**(INDEX `1`), **Light**(INDEX `2`) and
**Colourful**(INDEX `3`).

The command word for switching theme is `switch`. When the user type the command word `switch` and the **INDEX**
 of theme, `execute()` function in the `LogicManager` class will be called. Next the command line will be passed to
`AddressBookParser` class which then returns `SwitchThemeCommandParser` to separate the **INDEX** from command word.
The **INDEX** will be used to select the specific theme in the array of String `themeArr`. The theme selected
will be used to build the filepath, which allows `MainWindow` class to retrieve the respective `.css` file and update
theme accordingly.

The overview of the themes is as follows:
|===
| *1* Dark Theme | image:DarkTheme.png[width="500"] +
| *2* Light Theme | image:LightTheme.png[width="500"] +
| *3* Colourful Theme| image:ColourfulTheme.png[width="500"]
|===



==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The line `<URL value="@ThemeName.css" />` in `fxml` files is replaced by a method call via
`javafx.scene.layout.VBox` object in `MainWindow` class.
* In current version of Contact Plus, the `INDEX` must be 1, 2, or 3.
* The `SwitchThemeCommand` is currently not undoable.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `switch theme` feature +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use command line to switch theme. +
**Pros:** Only keyboard action is required. Users do not need to use mouse to click. +
**Cons:** Preview of theme is not available. Users will only find out after they execute the command.

**Alternative 2:** Use a selection window with theme preview image. +
**Pros:** Users are able to know what the theme looks like before they choose the respective theme. +
**Cons:** Additional space for `Theme Selection` window. +
// end::themeselect[]

// tag::addtask[]
=== Add Task Mechanism

The 'add task' feature is facilitated by `AddTaskCommand` class. It allows users to add tasks into the address book
with a description, the level of priority as well as the due date. The tasks added will be shown on the stickies
in the address book.

The command word for adding a task is `task`. When users key in the command word `task`, together with valid
description, priority and due date, the `execute()` function in the `LogicManager` class will be called, which will
pass the value of the command string into `parseCommand()` function in the `AddressBookParser` class.
As a result, `AddTaskCommandParser` will be returned to separate the command string into three different parts
- `Description`, `Priority` and `dueDate`. These three fields will be passed to `Task` class to check if they
are valid. If yes, a new `Task` object will be returned and used to call `AddTaskCommand` class. Eventually,
the `executeUndoableCommand()` function in `AddTaskCommand` class will be called and returns a `CommandResult` object to display once a task is successfully added.

image::AddTaskCommand_sequence_diagram.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The format of date must follow `dd/MM/yyyy`.
* The date must also be a valid date.
* The range of priority can only be from *0* to *2*. Any other values will be deemed as invalid, and an error message will be thrown.
* Currently, all fields must be included in the command and cannot be omitted.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `AddTaskCommand` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use stickies so that newly added tasks will show up in the stickies. +
**Pros:** Tasks are easy to identify. +
**Cons:** When too many tasks are added, it is difficult to display all the tasks. +

**Alternative 2:** Use a task list similar to the person list in the address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to display and look through all the tasks. +
**Cons:** Less attractive. +
// end::addtask[]

=== List Task Mechanism

//tag::listtask-mechanism[]

This mechanism is modelled by the `ListTaskCommand` class. An instance of
`ListTaskCommand` is created by the `AddressBookParser` class when the
user attempts to list tasks. The following sequence diagram shows the process from the
moment the user enters the `listtask` command until the tasks
are displayed in the interface of `Contact Plus`.

image::ListTaskCommand-sequence-diagram.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `taskDisplayed` variable in `CommandBox` must be set to the instance of the `BrowserPanel`
that contains the sticky where the tasks are to be displayed.
* The `getFilteredTaskList()` method in `Logic` class must return a list of `ReadOnlyTasks` containing
the tasks in the address book.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `listtask` command. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** List all the tasks in one sticky note. +
**Cons:** When too many tasks are added, the tasks will look very clutterd when displayed. +

**Alternative 2:** Use one sticky note to display each task. +
**Pros:** Interface will look much neater. +
**Cons:** Not scalable as it is not practical to generate a large number of sticky notes. +

//end::listtask-mechanism[]

=== Delete Task Mechanism

//tag::deletetask-mechanism[]

This mechanism is modelled by the `DeleteTaskCommand` class. An instance of
`DeleteTaskCommand` is created by the `AddressBookParser` class when the
user attempts to delete tasks. The following sequence diagram shows the process from the
moment the user enters the `deletetask` command until the remaining tasks
are displayed in the interface of `Contact Plus`.

image::DeleteTaskCommand-sequence-diagram.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `taskDisplayed` variable in `CommandBox` must be set to the instance of the `BrowserPanel`
that contains the sticky where the tasks are to be displayed.
* The `getFilteredTaskList()` method in `Logic` class must return a list of `ReadOnlyTasks` containing
the tasks in the address book.
* The `deleteTask()` method in model must be able to accept a `ReadOnlyTask` as input and
delete it from the address book.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of DeleteTaskCommand. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete tasks from the address book every time the user executes the command to
delete task. +
**Pros:** Don't have to keep track of which tasks are no longer valid. +
**Cons:** Causes overhead if the user repeatedly executes a command to delete tasks.

**Alternative 2:** Use lazy deletion (i.e. use a boolean array to mark which tasks are no longer valid) without
 automatically displaying the remaining tasks. Only delete tasks when
  the user chooses to list tasks. +
**Pros:** Less overhead as deletion only has to be done when user chooses to list tasks. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement and causes a lot of technical issues such as updating the
list of tasks when the user closes the address book after deletion.

//end::deletetask-mechanism[]

=== Edit Task Mechanism
The `edit task` is facilitated by EditTaskCommand class. It allows users to edit tasks in the address book with a description, the level of priority as well as the due date. The tasks added will be shown on the stickies in the address book.

The command word for editing a task is `edittask`. When users key in the command word, together with valid description, priority and due date, the values will be passed into parseCommand() function in the AddressBookParser class.

The basic main flow for `edittask` is as follows:

image:EditTaskMainFlow.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `getFilteredTaskList()` method in `Logic` class must return a list of `ReadOnlyTasks` containing
the tasks in the address book.
* The `updateTask()` method in model must be able to accept a `ReadOnlyTask` as input and
delete it from the address book.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** fields to be editable. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow priority and due date to be editable but not description.
**Pros:** It is logically clear that only the priority and due date of a task can be edited. Changing the description of the task essentially means to create a new task.
**Cons:** May be not convenient for users who want to edit description of the task as well.

**Alternative 2:** Only allow users to edit all three fields, description, priority and due date.
**Pros:** This provides larger flexibility for users to edit any part of the given task.
**Cons:** Logically it may not make sense to be able to edit description of the task.

=== Clear Task Mechanism

The `clear task` is facilitated by ClearTaskCommand class. It allows users to clear tasks in the address book.

The command word for listing a task is `cleartask`. When users key in the command word, the command word `cleartask` is passed into AddressBookParser class, and the corresponding `ClearTaskCommand` is created and subsequently its function executeUndoableCommand() will clear the tasks from addressbook.xml.

The basic main flow for `cleartask` is as follows:

image:listTaskActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The `getFilteredTaskList()` method in `Logic` class must return a list of `ReadOnlyTasks` containing
the tasks in the address book.
* The `deleteTask()` method in model must be able to accept a `ReadOnlyTask` as input and
delete it from the address book.


=== Sound Effect for Commands

// tag::music-feature[]

This mechanism is implemented in the `AudioUtil` class. The static method
`playClip()`, which plays a specified .wav format sound clip, is invoked on the `AudioUtil` class when a command is issued by
the user. Distinct sound clips will be played based on whether the command
was successfully executed or it failed to execute (due to various reasons such
as parse error). A visualization of this is shown in the following sequence diagram:

image::SoundEffect-sequence-diagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of the `playClip()` method in the `AudioUtil` class is shown below:

image::playClipMethod.png[width="800"]

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

* The audio file whose name is specified to the `playClip()` method must exist
in the src/resources/audio/ folder.
* The name of a .wav format audio clip should be provided to the `playClip()` method as
only this format has been tried and tested. Other audio file formats may/may not work.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of sound effects. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Play preset clips on command success or failure. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement as the clips to be played are always the same and will only be played
during two events. +
**Cons:** The sound clips are limited to two types - success or failure.

**Alternative 2:** Allow the user to select the command success and failure audio clips from
a predefined list. +
**Pros:** User is able to have more personalized settings. +
**Cons:** Technically challenging as additional commands have to be implemented to list
the available audio clips and select the desired ones.

//end::music-feature[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.6.1 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deletetag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
