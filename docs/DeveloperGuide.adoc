== Introduction

This _Developer Guide_ is written by the **BoNUS v1.5** team for the benefits of future developers and maintainers of the
application.

* This guide includes instructions for setting up the development environment.
* This guide provides sufficient UMLs (unified model diagrams) to illustrate the architectural structure and design methodology.
* This guide offers advice for troubleshooting some common issues.

**BoNUS** is an open-source project, should any developers be interested, see <<ContactUs#, Contact Us>> page for more information.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

+
[NOTE]
We do have the plan to upgrade to http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/[Java 9] in the foreseeable future. +
Please pay close attention to this document.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer (we use https://git-scm.com/[Git] as our version control system)
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms
(Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based). Thus, we strongly encourage you to set up both.

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

==== Using Git

We use https://git-scm.com/[Git] as our version control software (VCS). See <<UsingGit#, UsingGit.adoc>> if you find any difficulty when using Git.

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component._

_The diagram above shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Logic Component Class Diagram_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2(a) : Undo Stack_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2(b) : Undo Stack_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2(c) : Undo Stack_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3 : Undo Command Sequence Diagram_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4(a) : Redo Stack_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4(b) : Redo Stack_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.5 : Redo Command Activity Diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// tag::genericProperty[]
=== Generic property

We are using a generic `Property` class to support **arbitrary field** feature.

==== Inspiration

Users should not be limited to the provided four fields, i.e. `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address` (we are talking about
the contact component here, of course one more `DateTime` for event component). They should have the freedom to enter all
kinds of information about their contacts apart from the pre-defined ones.

Through a brief product survey on other existing similar software in the market, we found that they usually ask users to
type all other information in the _so-called_ `Description` or `Details` field. This is not a good design because doing
so will make the information stored messy. The application is used to organize personal information conveniently. It is
a major drawback if the data are not stored (and thus presented to users) in a well-organized way.

Learning from many modern database implementations, we should think of the data as two tables: one for *contacts* and the
other one for *events*. Each table is composed of many rows and many columns. A single contact/event is one row, while
all their different properties/fields are the columns (as can be seen from Figure 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2).

image::phpmyadminAddColumn.png[width="700"]
_Figure 4.3.1.2 : Add New Column in phpMyAdmin_

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Where to store the "_metadata_" of different properties (short name, full name, regular expression, etc.) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new class `PropertyManager` in Figure 4.3.2.1 +
**Pros:** Efficient (there is only one copy) and easy for future development since it is centralized. +
**Cons:** Requires major change to `Model` component and `Storage` component. +
**Alternative 2:** Store these data along with each specific property class, like `Name`, `Email` +
**Pros:** Able to adapt the current implementation of `Model` component. +
**Cons:** Hard to implement `AddPropertyCommand`, and difficult to manage as the project grows larger.

image::PropertyManagerClassDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.3.2.1 : Class Diagram for_ `PropertyManager`

==== Implementation Outline

. Create a more general class to capture the common patterns among all columns (all different fields/properties): according to
the basic OOP concept, a more generic class should become the superclass `Property`; then, other more specific classes
(like `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, etc.) can inherit from it. This design reduces a lot of code duplicates.

. Find a way to store the metadata of all columns (fields/properties): in popular SQL database implementation, they
usually have a separate database reserved for the database server system itself. We must store similar information somewhere
as well. Thus, we create a `PropertyManager` to store these "metadata", including short names, full names, constraint
messages and regular expressions used for input validation. They are all `static` variables because there should only be
one copy of these "metadata". It will waste a lot of resources if we store these "metadata" with each instance of the
`Property` class.

. _Pre-loaded properties_: Things like `Name`, `Email` and `Phone` are widely used. They should ship with the application
and users do not need any additional setup steps to use them.

. Add new customize properties: advanced users should be provided with a command (`config --add-property`) to add their
own customize fields (as shown in Figure 4.3.3.1). They should have the freedom to arbitrarily choose things like short
name, full name, etc. They can easily add/edit these properties of each contact stored in the application, just like the
_pre-loaded_ ones.

image::PropertyManagerSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.3.1 : Sequence Diagram for Adding a Customize Property_
// end::genericProperty[]

//tag::autoReminders[]
=== Auto reminders

We are adding a reminder to the event whenever an event is added. Reminders will notify users 2 days in advance before
event itself.

As we are targeting NUS students, in view of the busy schedules of students, students should be able to set reminders
for events that they have to attend to. In the case that students forget to set reminders themselves, we automatically
preset a reminder that will trigger from 2 days before the event such that students have ample time to be aware and be
prepared for the event itself.

Learning from many modern applications, the logic behind the applications are usually efficient and is able to handle
multiple tasks at once. By automatically adding reminders alongside the addition of events, it makes it more
convenient for the users themselves. We have set a default reminder to trigger 2 days before the actual event
to remind users of their upcoming events via different colour schemes.

As shown in the _Figure 4.4.1_

1. The red bell indicates the day of the event
2. The orange bell indicates one day before event.
3. The green bell indicates two days before event.

image::ReminderColorScheme.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : Reminders via different colour schemes to indicate urgency_


==== Design Consideration
**Aspect:**  How to implement the idea of reminders into Events +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new reminder class that contains an event parameter to it. Events have a +
list of reminders within them (Figure 4.4.1.1). +
**Pros:** Independent. Reminder class is on its own and easy for future usage since it is already a class by itself. +
Each reminder is tagged to an event, such that if we want to access the reminders in an event, it is easy to do so. +
**Cons:** Require major changes to Logic and Model components for Event +
**Alternative 2:** Add a new parameter for Event called Reminders to display time till event. +
**Pros:** Less changes as it is just an implementation of a new parameter. +
**Cons:** Less versatile and reminders cannot be applied anywhere else if needed. +

image::ReminderClassDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.4.1.1 : Class Diagram for `Reminder`_

Therefore we have decided to adopt alternative 1 of creating a Reminder class as it is more versatile for future usage.

==== Implementation Outline

1. Create a ReadOnlyReminder class such that it only contains immutable instances of Reminders.

2. Create a general class such that Reminder that implements ReadOnlyReminder. It can inherit properties
such as `DateTime` from PropertyClass as well. In the event that a new property needs to be added, it can be done.
Such a design makes Reminder class more adaptable to changes and ready for future code usage.

3. `Reminder` is now more open to changes if needed and can easily add parameters and methods now that it is a class
on its own.

4. Have a list of reminders in `Event` class (Figure 4.4.2.1). Since `Event` can have multiple reminders, each reminder is
instantiated with an `Event` parameter in it such that a `Reminder` is tagged to an Event itself. Figure 4.4.2.2 depicts the
relationship between `Event` and `Reminder`.

image::EventClassDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.4.2.1 : Class Diagram for `Event`_

image::EventReminderRS.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.4.2.2 : Relationship of Event and Reminder_

The following sequence diagram (Figure 4.4.2.3) shows how reminders are automatically added upon the addition of events.

_Figure 4.4.2.3 : Sequence Diagram for Adding an event (reminders are automatically added)_
//end::autoReminders[]

//tag::themeSwitch[]
=== Switch themes mechanism

As BoNUS is targeted at students, we want to allow students to personalise BoNUS. To open up such a
possibility, we decided to introduce the `SwitchThemeCommand` to support bright and dark
themes.

In the following sections below, the Switch Themes mechanism will be elaborated with the aid of
illustrated diagrams to depict the interactions between the components in BoNUS.

The _Sequence Diagram_ in _Figure 4.5.1_ illustrates how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command
`theme`. Also, the _Sequence Diagram_ illustrates the events-driven architectural style in BoNUS.

image::SDforSwitchTheme.png[width="500", height="300"]
_Figure 4.5.1 : Events-Driven nature of Switch Theme_

image::SDforSwitchThemesEmphasis.png[width="500", height="300"]
_Figure 4.5.2 : Sequence diagram for Switch Theme mechanism_


As can be seen from _Figure 4.5.2_, upon the execution of `theme` command, SwitchThemeEvent
is then raised :
[source,java]
----
public class SwitchThemeCommand extends Command {

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "theme";
    public static final String COMMAND_ALIAS = "t";

    public static final String MESSAGE_USAGE = COMMAND_WORD + ": Toggles between bright and dark theme.\n"
            + "Example: " + COMMAND_WORD;

    public static final String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "Theme switched!";

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        raise(new SwitchThemeEvent());
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }
}
----

It is from there that the event will be handled by `MainWindow` where the change of theme occurs as shown below:
[source,java]

----
 @Subscribe
    private void handleThemeChanged(SwitchThemeEvent event) {
        if (prefs.getAddressBookTheme() == darkTheme) {
            getRoot().getStylesheets().clear();
            getRoot().getStylesheets().add(brightTheme);
            getRoot().getStylesheets().add(brightExtension);
            prefs.setAddressBookTheme(brightTheme);
        } else {
            getRoot().getStylesheets().clear();
            getRoot().getStylesheets().add(darkTheme);
            getRoot().getStylesheets().add(darkExtension);
            prefs.setAddressBookTheme(darkTheme);
        }

    }
----

==== Design Consideration
**Aspect:**  How to implement the `theme` command  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `SwitchThemeCommand` command under `Logic` component.
Create an event for it to handle +
the switching of themes in `MainWindow`. Implement the switch theme process in `MainWindow`. No parsing is involved since +
it is switching between two themes. +
**Pros:** Simple interaction between `UI` and `Logic` by raising an event to handle the changing of themes in `MainWindow` +
from `SwitchThemeCommand` under the `Logic` component. +
**Cons:** Without parsing, only two themes can be set. +
**Alternative 2:** Handle theme switch by directly accessing `MainWindow` from `SwitchThemeCommand` +
**Pros:** Shortcut to make the `theme` command work. +
**Cons:** `Logic` and `UI` component should not be easily interchangeably accessed in this manner. Also, it violates
 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). `Logic` is only supposed to handle logic components such as commands, it should
 not be able to openly access `UI` components such as `MainWindow`.  +

==== Implementation Outline

1. Create a `SwitchThemeCommand` under logic component. Create a `SwitchThemeEvent` for `EventBus` to handle the event
accordingly whenever `SwitchThemeCommand` is executed.

2. Create a CSS file for BrightTheme which include its main CSS file as well as its extension files. Remove the default
CSS styles from the `FXML` files in BoNUS.

3. Implement the switching of themes in `MainWindow`. Create a method in `MainWindow` to subscribe it to the event change.
Raise the event whenever `SwitchThemeCommand` is executed such that the theme will change accordingly in `MainWindow`.
//end::themeSwitch[]

// tag::importExportXml[]
=== Import & export XML mechanism

In order to open up more possibilities to BoNUS, we have introduced the `import` and `export` commands. We are using
`ImportXmlCommand` and `ExportCommand` to support importing and exporting of address book data through XML files.

In the following sections, we will focus on how these commands depend on the `Storage` component to retrieve external
data, as well as the file path validation mechanism adopted on a high-level basis.

==== Implementation

===== External Data Access

In order to achieve their tasks, both `import` and `export` commands natively require access to the external
environment, unlike other commands. Hence, these commands are designed to depend directly on the `Storage` component.

The dependence of `Storage` in `import` and `export` is achieved through the `Command.setStorage(Storage)` method. This
method mimics the existing `Command.setData(Model, CommandHistory, UndoRedoStack)` method, where only commands that make
use of the relevant data will override this method to gain access to the dependencies.

The following shows the implementation of `Command.setStorage(Storage)`, which is not overridden commands other than
`ImportXmlCommand` and `ExportCommand`:

[source,java]
----
public void setStorage(Storage storage) {
    // intentionally left empty
}
----

In `ImportXmlCommand` and `ExportCommand`, the overridden method is implemented in this way:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void setStorage(Storage storage) {
    this.storage = storage;
}
----

Through this implementation, commands that depend directly on the `Storage` component (ie. `import` and `export`) are
able to gain full access to `Storage`, while commands that do not rely on `Storage` remain weakly coupled to it. The
following class diagram of the `Logic` component reflects the overall implementation on an architectural-level point of
view:

image::LogicClassDiagramStorageEmphasis.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

===== File Path Validation

File paths, as required by `import` and `export` commands, are validated during the execution of the corresponding
command. The following sequence diagram shows an example of how file path validation is performed prior exporting the
address book data:

image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1.2 : Sequence Diagram for Export Command_

To facilitate better handling of invalid file paths and to provide appropriate feedback to the user, several exception
classes, all of which are derived from the `InvalidFilePathException` class, have been implemented. The following shows
the inheritance diagram of the above-mentioned exception classes:

image::CommonsComponentExceptionClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1.3 : Structure of Exception Classes related to File Path Validation_

With that, we are able to ensure that data would be exported to or imported from a truly valid file path as specified by
the user, while being able to inform users on the mistakes that they have made.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `Storage` dependency for `ImportXmlCommand` and `ExportCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new `setStorage(Storage)` method in `Command` +
**Pros:** Provides direct access to `Storage` for commands that only requires it. +
**Cons:** There is an inherent dependency on `Storage` for all commands, although the coupling is weak. +
**Alternative 2:** Raise a `BaseEvent` in the `EventsCenter` through `Model` +
**Pros:** Completely decouples `Command` from `Storage`. +
**Cons:** The need for access to `Storage` is not a side-effect as with other commands that mutate the address book +
(eg. `add`, `delete` etc.). The dependency of `Storage` is part of their native behaviour.

---

**Aspect:** Location for Implementation of File Path Validation +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** In `Storage` +
**Pros:** Validation is not just done for user input file paths (ie. via `import` and `export` commands), but also for the address book file path as defined in the user's preferences (ie. `preferences.json`). +
**Cons:** Validation is performed after every execution of an `UndoableCommand` due to the saving of the address book. +
**Alternative 2:** In `CommandParser` +
**Pros:** Validation will not be done after every execution of an `UndoableCommand` unnecessarily. +
**Cons:** File path validation may also be required for other purposes.
// end::importExportXml[]

// tag::importNusmods[]
=== Import timetable from NUSMods

We implement an  `ImportNusmodsCommand` to help users directly import their NUSMods timetable to *BoNUS* by simply copy-paste
the URL.

==== Inspiration

As stated in <<UserGuide#, User Guide>>, *BoNUS* helps you _better(B) organize(o) your NUS life_. Thus, we want to make
the application an integrated personal manager for NUS students. The main activities for most students are study-related and
most NUS students are currently using https://nusmods.com/[NUSMods] to build their school timetable (as shown in Figure 4.7.1.1).

image::NusmodsWebsite.png[width="750"]
_Figure 4.7.1.1 : NUSMods Website Interface_

Let's imagine some of our users want to use the event feature in *BoNUS*. They want to input final examinations for all
the modules they are taking as upcoming events. It would be very inconvenient and tedious if they have to do this manually.
Even worse, it is very likely they are already using NUSMods and thus are not willing to add these events again. They may
end up not using the event feature at all.

However, users may find it very useful if they can import their NUSMods timetable using a simple command. Eventually, they
would choose *BoNUS* because they can manage both contacts and events in one application conveniently and the migration
from NUSMods to *BoNUS* is not troublesome.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Relationship between `ImportXmlCommand` and `ImportNusmodsCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract `ImportCommand` class and let both of them become its sub-commands
(inherit from it). +
**Pros:** This is inspired by many popular command-line tools (like Git). `import` is called the actual command, while
`--xml` and `--script` is called the options. Most Unix/Linux users would be used to this approach. This is important for
us because we assume our users are typists and they are very likely to frequently use these command-line tools. +
**Cons:** Need to write extra codes and parsing also becomes more complicated. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement these two commands separately. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and similar to other commands. +
**Cons:** Our users may not be used to it. The command word will become longer. It is not a good OOP practice as well
because common details are not abstracted into a parent class and this produces duplicate codes.

_(Similar strategy has been adopted in `ConfigCommand`)_

---

**Aspect:** How to obtain user's NUSMods timetable +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let users copy-paste the URL as a parameter of `ImportNusmodsCommand`. +
**Pros:** Simple to use and easy to implement as well +
**Cons:** Need to check whether the URL is valid and from NUSMods (currently using regular expression). +
**Alternative 2:** Implement a built-in browser and render the NUSMods page +
**Pros:** Users are more used to this interface. +
**Cons:** Need much extra work to implement the built-in browser. The page may not be rendered well since the built-in
browser is typically smaller than OS browser and NUSMods does not fully adopt link:#mainstream-os[responsive UI framework]
and may not work well on a small browser window.

==== Implementation Outline

===== `ImportCommand` abstract class

Create an `ImportCommand` abstract class and let `ImportXmlCommand` and `ImportNusmodsCommand` inherit from it (as in
Figure 4.7.3.1). It is also a good practice to use an enumeration `ImportType` because the possible types of the import
are within a fixed set of values. This leads to better modularity in `ImportCommandParser` as well.

image::ImportNusmodsClassDiagram.png[width="600"]
_Figure 4.7.3.1 : Class Diagram for Related Import Commands_ +

===== Parsing of NUSMods Timetable URL

Implement utility method to validate a given URL and parse the `GET` parameters. Although it is possible to utilize
external library like https://hc.apache.org/[Apache HttpComponents], we decide to implement on our own because it is relative
simple to do so and using external library comes with extra expenses (such as licence, etc).

[source,java]
----
public static Map<String, String> fetchUrlParameters(URL url) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
    String query = urlDecode(url.getQuery());

    if (Strings.isNullOrEmpty(query)) {
        return Collections.emptyMap();
    }

    Map<String, String> pairs = new HashMap<>();
    for (String pair: query.split("&")) {
        int index = pair.indexOf("=");
        pairs.put(pair.substring(0, index), pair.substring(index + 1));
    }

    return pairs;
}
----

===== Fetch information from NUSMods API

The URL parsed just now only contains the module codes and grouping for each module. In order to add upcoming events, we
need more information such as module names, examination dates, etc. We decide to use API provided by NUSMods to fetch the
information we need. NUSMods API is in JSON format, which would be very simple for us as we already use
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] library in our project.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Read JSON data from a given URL and convert the data to an instance of the given class.
 * @param url is the URL to the remote JSON data.
 */
public static <T> T fromJsonUrl(URL url, Class<T> instanceClass) throws IOException {
    return objectMapper.readValue(url, instanceClass);
}
----

===== Add upcoming events

After obtaining all the information we need, we can simply use the `addEvent` method in `ModelManager` class to add the
final examinations as upcoming events into *BoNUS*. This should be a similar process as `AddEventCommand`.
// end::importNusmods[]

=== Contacts/event listing order by name/date time mechanism

Whenever there is a command that triggers the "_refresh_" of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/person/PersonListPanel.java[`PersonListPanel`]
or link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/event/EventListPanel.java[`EventListPanel`], like when adding a new contact
(i.e. `add` command), all the cards will be loaded in the incremental order by name or date time respectively. The sorting
mechanism uses the `sort` method which resides inside `List` interface to sort the contacts by name.

// tag::emailMech[]
=== Emailing mechanism

The automatic opening of email on the user's desktop is facilitated mainly by the `Desktop` class which allows the Java
application to launch the default mail application registered inside the user's native desktop to handle the email `URI`.
// end::emailMech[]

// tag::calendarMech[]
=== Calendar mechanism

An in-built calendar is added to the panel beside the list of events. This calendar shows a monthly view of the
current month.

image::Calendar.png[width="600"]
_Figure 4.10.1 : Calendar for month of November 2017_

This is useful for users to be able to compare their list of events in the calendar. It can help users to check what
day of the week their event is happening on. This is especially useful for NUS students as there is a fixed daily
schedule and it would be easy to check what day it falls on to ensure their availability for the event. Other usages
include having to see what dates lie on a particular day for students to plan weekly events. All in all, it provides a
convenient way for students to have access to a calendar without having to open any external applications.

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect*: How to display the individual dates. +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use a GridPane to design the table in XML. Include a class to calculate dates to be
shown, before populating individual cells in GridPane using data from class. +
*Pros:* This method makes use of JavaFX, possibly allowing us to improve the aesthetic design in the future. It also
allows individual objects to be created for individual cells. This could allow us to write more functionality such
as showing number of events per day to dynamic colour changes in the future. The `monthDateBuilder` method provides an
accurate graphical representation of the days in a monthly calendar. +
*Cons:* The 42 cell design is fairly cumbersome, requiring the initialization of at least 42 cells. The class is limited
in a way that it must have 42 cells, thus sometimes many cells are left unused, and there is a wastage of memory. +
*Alternative 2:* Use JTable to display individual dates. +
*Pros:* A ready to use API that can allow  easy building of table showing dates. It is also a powerful tool with many
functions. +
*Cons:* JTable is a UI element from a different UI design model, and cannot make use of advantages brought about by the
new advantages from JavaFX, such as the node capability of JavaFX and certain aesthetic modifications. Many of the
JTable functions might not be used.

==== Implementation Outline

1. Create a `EventCalendar` class that contains the month that will be shown, containing all the necessary information
required for a monthly calendar (i.e. dates, name of month).

2. Create a `monthDateBuilder` class that will be used to set the current month and year of the calendar. It will also be
arranging the dates in a way that will correspond to which day of the week it belongs to.

3. Use `Calendar` class to set the current year and month and store in an array (i.e.`monthYearArray`) in
`monthDateBuilder`. Also, use `Calendar` class to set the number of days in the current month and the day that the first
date of the month falls on (i.e. set using `setMonthAnchors` method). These details are required to build the monthly
view.

4. There are a maximum of 42 cells to fill up in every month. Create a method (i.e. `buildMonthArray` method) to
store the position of the dates in. Use an algorithm to store all the dates before the first date of the month as a
blank, fill up the subsequent dates using the value of the first day of the month and their cell number, and the
leftover dates will continue to be blanks until the 42nd cell.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use AsciiDoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose AsciiDoc over Markdown because AsciiDoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

==== Using Google Chrome PDF printer

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.3.1 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

==== Using `asciidoc-pdf` Ruby gem

If you have Ruby installed on your development machine, we suggest you using a useful gem `asciidoc-pdf` to automatically
convert the documentation into PDF format.

You can find more information about `asciidoc-pdf` from their https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[GitHub repository].
Instructions on how to use it can also be found on AsciiDoctor website at http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[here].

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Ways to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time.
2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components.

=== Example Programming Task - Creating a new command: `remark`

The section below _walks_ you on how to create a new command called `remark`. By creating this command, you will get a chance
to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
