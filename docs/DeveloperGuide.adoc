== Introduction

=== Purpose

UniCity is a contact management command line desktop application implemented in Java. This developer guide aims to provide
adequate information for a new developer to understand the underlying structure of UniCity and how it works.

=== Overview

This guide covers the following: +

* Design architecture of UniCity. +
* Implementation details of main features such as undoing and redoing of previous commands, logging, configuration and
etc. +
* Software testing and integration for future releases. +
* Additional information covered by the appendix section. +

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repository.
. Clone the forked repository to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

Set up Travis to perform CI for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures UniCity works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding:

1. Get a sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given in Figure 2.1.1 explains the high-level design of UniCity. Information provided below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, simply modify the diagram in the pptx file, edit the objects of the diagram accordingly and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many other classes to write log messages to UniCity's log file.

The rest of UniCity consists of four components:

* link:#ui-component[*`User Interface(UI)`*] : The UI of UniCity to showcase the styling of UniCity.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor to execute commands.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : UniCity build-in memory to store data.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : The hard disk to read data from and writes data to.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see figure 2.1.2 given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ in figure 2.1.3a shows how the different components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram in figure 2.1.3b shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== User Interface (UI) component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As shown in figure 2.2, the `UI` component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `ExtendedPersonList`, `CalendarView`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  As shown in figure 2.3.1, `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager` as shown in figure 2.3.2.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 2.3.3 below shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` shown in figure 2.4:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component shown in figure 2.5:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::favourite[]
=== Favourite mechanism (Since v1.2)
To favourite a contact is achieved by `FavouriteCommand`. It basically changes the value of the `Favourite` field of a `Person`. The `Favourite` class has two status indicators: one is a boolean value and the other is a String. The boolean one is used in the constructor while the String one is for UI and output purposes.

In this sense, `Favourite` class needs to be created to store the favourite status of a contact. As `AddCommand` does not involve `Favourite`, the default `Favourite` status for every newly added `Person` is false.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `FavouriteCommand` is processed:

image::FavouriteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

To make the default status of a `Favourite` field "False", the default constructor of `Favourite` takes no arguments and set the boolean indicator to false. The value of the String indicator is synchronised with the boolean indicator. But in some cases, such as JUnit Tests, a `FavouriteCommand` needs to be initialised in such a way that its status is "True". Thus, another constructor that takes in a boolean argument is also available. The following shows the two different constructors:
[source,java]
----
    public Favourite() {
        this.favourite = false;
        this.status = "False";
    }

    public Favourite(boolean favourite) {
        this.favourite = favourite;
        this.status = favourite ? "True" : "False";
    }
----

In addition, the utility class `PersonBuilder` is also modified to set the default value of `Favourite` to each newly created object.

`FavouriteCommand` takes in an integer as its argument. The command is first being parsed in `AddressBookParser` to be identified as an instance of `FavouriteCommand`. Then it is parsed by `FavouriteCommandParser` to parse the index. Invalid indexes will be handled by throwing an exception. This is how `FavouriteCommandParser` is implemented:
[source,java]
----
public class FavouriteCommandParser implements Parser<FavouriteCommand> {
    public FavouriteCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        try {
            // ... parse index and pass it to `FavouriteCommand`...
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            // ... throw an exception ...
        }
    }
}
----

To update the `Favourite` field of a `Person`, the other information of the specific `Person` is copied into a newly created `Person` instance. The new `Favourite` value will be set to be opposite of the original one. This is implemented in the following way:
[source,java]
----
public class FavouriteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    // ... variables, constructor and other overrided methods ...
    Boolean changedToFav;

    @Override
        protected CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
            // ... fetch personToEdit ...

             Favourite favourite = personToEdit.getFavourite();
             favourite.toggleFavourite();
             changedToFav = favourite.getFavourite();

             Person editedPerson = new Person(personToEdit.getName(), personToEdit.getPhone(), personToEdit.getEmail(), personToEdit.getAddress(), favourite, personToEdit.getBirthday(), personToEdit.getTags());

            // ... try replace personToEdit with editedPerson ...
        }
}
----

It is important to display `Favourite` in the user interface. `PersonCard` is modified to contain a `favouriteLabel` that changes its appearance based on the favourite status of the person. It will first detect the boolean favourite status of the person. If the person is a favourite contact, a yellow star will be shown. Otherwise, a transparent star with black border will be show. The colours of the border and the background of the label are set to transparent, so that only the background picture, which is a star, will be shown.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Store `Favourite` values +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new `Favourite` class +
**Pros:** Follows how `Address`, `EMAIL` and all other personal information are stored. It also follows the open-close principle and exercises cohesion, where all matters related to `Favourite` field is dealt in its own class. +
**Cons:** Need to change a lot of code because adding a new class will affect UI, Logic, Model and Storage. +
**Alternative 2:** Keep it as a `Boolean` value +
**Pros:** Does not need to create another class. Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** Potentially catastrophic because some Boolean methods need to be overwritten. It is also prone to bugs when developers forget to change the ObjectProperty to `String` in UI classes.

---

**Aspect:** Indicating `Favourite` values +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Two indicators: one boolean and one String +
**Pros:** Using the boolean indicator in conditional loops can reduce the complexity of the code. It is also more natural to have a binary value of the favourite status. It also exercises defensive programming, because passing a String parameter to the constructor may break the application if the argument is illegal (anything besides "True" and "False"). By also having a String indicator, it is much easier to output the value of the favourite status. +
**Cons:** Need to create one more variable in the `Favourite` class. Also additional attention needs to be given to avoid problems where the two indicators are not synchronised. +
**Alternative 2:** Only use a String indicator +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** Dangerous as it is prone to bugs when an illegal String value is passed to the constructor. It is also not natural to have a String indicator for a supposedly binary one. +

---

**Aspect:** Change the `Favourite` value of the selected `Person` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy values from other fields to a newly created `Person` instance. Then add an opposite value of the old `Favourite` to the instance. +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates. Also by using `ReadOnlyPerson` for the person being selected, we can ensure its original value will be intact. This is crucial if updating person failed in the later stage. +
**Cons:** Additional space consumed to store a new `Person` instance. +
**Alternative 2:** Edit `Favourite` field on the spot +
**Pros:** No additional new instance needs to be instantiated. Even easier to understand. +
**Cons:** Modifying original values directly can be potentially dangerous. The safer alternative is to create a duplicate, and perform operations on it. +
// end::favourite[]


// tag::filterbytags[]
=== Filter mechanism

The filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommandParser`, which resides inside the parser folder of the logic component.

Similar to how the find mechanism searches for names of the contacts, the filter mechanism supports the search for specific tags (e.g. `friend`, `professor`).

The `FilterCommand` will inherit from `Command`.

When the command word `filter` is typed into UniCity, `AddressBookParser` will call `FilterCommandParser`.

`FilterCommandParser` then takes in the command argument(s), delimits the arguments if there are more than one keyword separated by spaces, wraps them with
the `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` class before parsing them into the FilterCommand constructor.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram when `LogicManager` executes the filter command.

image::filtercommandsequencediagram.png[width="800"]

Upon execution, the `FilterCommand` filters the list of contacts whose tags contains the tag words in the predicates. This is achieved with the help of the `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`
method from the `ModelManager` class.

The test to check for tag compatibility between the searched word and each person's tag(s) are implemented as follows:
[source,java]
----
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        return keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsTag(person.getTags(), keyword));
    }

----

Naturally, a person may contain a set of tags so the `containsTag` method from `StringUtil` class iterates through the persons tag list and checks for any tag words contained in the searched keyword(s).

[source,java]
----
public static boolean containsTag(Set<Tag> tagList, String word) {


    //...word is groomed to become preppedWord..
    //check if there is more than one tag searched.
    //more than 1 tag searched. split into a list of searches.
    if (preppedWord.contains(space)) {
        String[] separateTags = word.split(" ");
        List<String> tagFilters = Arrays.asList(separateTags);
        for (Tag tag : tagList) {
            if (haveMatchedTags(tagFilters, tag)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    //only 1 tag searched. Check if tagList contains word as a tag
    try {
        Tag checkTag = new Tag(preppedWord);
        return tagList.contains(checkTag);
    //..exceptions caught..
----

The user has to key in keywords after the filter command word. The filtering process is case-sensitive; it will only match keywords with tags of the exact same case and letters.

[NOTE]
A contact will be filtered once any of its tag(s) matches the keyword(s), it need match all of the keywords stated.

Should the user decide to be more specific in his tag filtering, he would have to narrow his search to fewer keyword(s).

A successful filter request will show the list of filtered persons under the contact column.

Should there be no contacts whose tags matches the keywords, UniCity will reply with a `0 persons listed!`

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Case and letter tolerance of `containsTag()` method in `StringUtil` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** check for exact keywords, case-sensitive and letter-specific, using the method `List.contains(Object E)` +
**Pros:** Implementation is easier on the developers' side. Users can avoid unnecessary filtered contacts when a longer tag word containing the keyword exists in another contact. Yet that might not be his desired filter.
 User may introduce more combinations of tags, possibly the same word but with different cases, that serves different purposes. +
**Cons:** Users might neglect the discrepancies between words, eg (`friend` versus `friends`). In the situation where the user forgets which tags he stored his contacts under, or
some of his contacts may have tags that serve the same purpose but spelt differently (as shown in the previous example), he will struggle to filter them. +
**Alternative 2:** Account for case-insensitive and incomplete words in `containsTag()` method +
**Pros:** Easier for users to filter tags. Accounts for any minor spelling or case discrepancies and still provides relatively accurate filters for the users. +
**Cons:** May involve additional code for developers to consider. Users may filter unnecessary contacts that contain some of the keywords.

---

**Aspect:** Filter criteria: Match tolerance between the typed keywords and a person's tags +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** A contact will be filtered as long as any of its tag(s) matches any of the keyword(s) stated by the user. +
**Pros:** User can widen his filter search on his list of contacts regardless of the combination of tags so the user may be able to find his contacts more easily.  +
**Cons:** The filter command may include unnecessary filtered contacts when the user specifies more than one keyword and expects only the contacts with ALL such tags. Eg. A user may
 indicate that he wants to filter contacts that has both `tutor` AND `professor` tags instead of contacts with either tutor` OR `professor` tags; the latter will result in more contacts
  showing, some which may deem unnecessary to the user +
**Alternative 2:** A contact will be filtered only if all its tags meet the required keyword(s). +
**Pros:** The user is able to narrow down his filter to specific and more accurate contacts +
**Cons:** The user might prefer a wider filter for either-or keywords as he might have forgotten which tag a particular contact was saved under. Narrowing down his filter may cause him some difficulties.

=== Sorting mechanism (Since v1.2)

The sorting mechanism is achieved by the `SortCommand`. In order to sort the list of contacts, the default constructor of `SortCommand` creates an empty editable array list of contacts as shown below:

[source,java]
----
private ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson> contactList;
public SortCommand() {
    contactList = new ArrayList<>();
}
----

The new list will take in a list of contacts from address book, sort the contacts and overwrite the existing list of contacts in address book sorted by alphabetical order.
The `SortCommand` inherits from `Command` instead of `UndoableCommands` so there is no mechanism for sorting to be undone.

The `SortCommand` is implemented in the following way:
[source,java]
----
public class SortCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... sort logic ....
    }
}
----
When the command word `sort` or `st` is entered in UniCity, `AddressBookParser` will call `SortCommandParser`.

Upon calling the function, an editable contactList containing ReadOnlyPerson will be empty at the beginning.

When the user executes `SortCommand`, `sort` or `st`, to sort the list of contacts in address book. The current empty ArrayList of contactList will be sent to the model ........

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[source,java]
----
public Boolean sortPersonByName(ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson> contactList) {

    //check the condition of the list of contacts in addressbook currently
    //different Boolean value will be returned depending on the order of the contacts
    if (filteredPersons.size() == 0) {
        return null;
    }
    contactList.addAll(filteredPersons);
    Collections.sort(contactList, Comparator.comparing(p -> p.toString().toLowerCase()));

    if (contactList.equals(filteredPersons)) {
        return false;
    }
    try {
        addressBook.setPersons(contactList);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
    }
    //...exceptions caught...
    return true;
}
----

Upon successful sorting, the `SortCommand` will correctly sort the contacts in alphabetical order and display the contacts under the `PersonListPanel`.

If there is an empty list, the address book will show a message saying `No contact to be sorted.` +
If the list is in correct order, the address book will show a message saying `Already sorted.`

[NOTE]
The sorting process is case insensitive.

==== Design considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `SortCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `SortCommand` will inherit directly from `Command` without the undo/redo mechanism. +
**Pros:** After the user has finished sorting his list of contacts, it will remain sorted without reverting back to the original list.  +
**Cons:** The user can no longer obtain the list of contacts with the original order. +
**Alternative 2:** The `SortCommand` will implement undo/redo mechanism. +
**Pros:** All contacts will be able to return to the original order when undo is applied. +
**Cons:** It may be troublesome for the user as he may want to undo a delete/add function but the list of contacts becomes unsorted and he must sort again.

**Aspect:** How sorting is executed +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorting is accomplished using the in-built function in `Collections` to sort the arrays according to alphabetical order. +
**Pros:** This method is straightforward and easy to implement. +
**Cons:** The algorithm is in-built so it is harder to debug if something goes wrong. +
**Alternative 2:** Writing my own sorting algorithm. +
**Pros:** This method can cater to case sensitivity and other exceptions of the list when sorting is involved. +
**Cons:** The algorithm may be more prone to error and may not be straightforward enough.

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the sort command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create an empty array list to obtain the data from the contact list and sort the contacts. It will overwrite the existing array list of unsorted contacts when sorted. +
**Pros:** This method is easier to understand and the original list of contacts is not changed to prevent any unexpected mistakes from occurring. +
**Cons:** This method may have performance issues due to additional memory usage and longer time taken to overwrite the given list of contacts. +
**Alternative 2:** Edit the current list of contacts directly by adding a function to the `AddressBook` class. +
**Pros:** This method is less time and storage consuming as sorting is achieved in a single array. +
**Cons:** There is no way to obtain the original list of contacts for other functions. If a mistake is made, the original list of contacts will be compromised. There is a need to update all classes that inherits from `AddressBook` class which may be confusing.

// end::sort[]
// birthday: birthday[]
=== Birthday mechanism (Since v1.3)
The birthday mechanism is achieved by the `AddBirthdayCommand`. In order to add a birthday value to a contact, the default constructor of `AddBirthdayCommand`
takes in the index of the contact and the birthday value to be added to the contact.

`AddBirthdayCommand` will use the arguments and parse to `AddressBookParser`. This instance is then sent to `AddBirthdayCommandParser` which parse the index and birthday entered.
Invalid indexes and command format will be handled by throwing an exception as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class AddBirthdayCommandParser implements Parser<BirthdayCommand> {
    public BirthdayCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        try {
            // ... parse index and pass it to `BirthdayCommand`...
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            // ... throw an exception ...
        }
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how `AddBirthdayCommand` is processed:

image::BirthdaySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Upon successfully adding of the birthday value to the contact with the given index shown in the list, it will change the value of the `Birthday` field of a `Person`.

At the same time, the `Birthday` class checks for the valid date entered by the user to ensure that it is in the format of DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYY. +
As `Birthday` is an optional field, the default constructor of `Birthday` takes no arguments and set the default birthday to the `Birthday` field for `Person`. The default value to be used will be "No Birthday Added`.
In some cases, `BirthdayCommand` needs to be initialized with a certain birthday for testing. Hence, another constructor is used to add a certain birthday to the `Birthday` field.

[source,java]
----
public Birthday () {
    this.birthdayNumber = DEFAULT_BIRTHDAY;
}

public Birthday(String birthday) throws IllegalValueException {
    String trimmedBirthday = birthday.trim();
    if (!isValidBirthdayFormat(trimmedBirthday)) {
        throw new
            IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_BIRTHDAY_CONSTRAINTS);
    }
    this.birthdayNumber = trimmedBirthday;
}
----

The `AddBirthdayCommand` inherits from the `UndoableCommand` so that users can undo the command of adding a birthday by accident.
The birthday value added will be displayed in the `ExtendedPersonListPanel` instead of `PersonCard` as it is additional information for each contact.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Changing of the `Birthday` value of the selected `Person` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy values from all fields including the newly added birthday value to a newly created `Person`. Then replace this `Person` with the old `Person` in the `AddressBook` class. +
**Pros:** This is easy to implement and it ensures that the original value will be intact in case any other information is changed. +
**Cons:** Additional space is used to store the new `Person` instance. +
**Alternative 2:** Edit the `Birthday` field in the given list of contacts directly.  +
**Pros:** No additional space is needed to store the `Person` instance and more straightforward. +
**Cons:** The data can no longer be retrieved if there is any error in the process of adding birthday to the contact.

**Aspect:** Storing of the `Birthday` value of the selected `Person` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new `Birthday` class. +
**Pros:** Same coding format stored as `Name`, `Phone` and other information so the coding principle is standardized. It can also perform validation checks for the birthday value easily. +
**Cons:** Add a new class affects many components of the code and much work needs to be done to make the changes. +
**Alternative 2:** Use a `String` value to keep track of birthday for each `Person`. +
**Pros:** This is easier and faster to implement. +
**Cons:** It is prone to bugs as the `String` value can be overwritten easily.

// end::birthday[]
// tag::facebook[]
=== Facebook mechanism

The facebook mechanism is facilitated by `FacebookCommand`, which resides inside the commands folder of the logic component.

The facebook mechanism displays the Facebook search page of the person specified by the index number inputted.
// end::facebook[]

image::facebook-command-ui.png[width="800"]
// tag::facebookcont[]
Upon execution, the `FacebookCommand` posts a `ShowFacebookRequestEvent` event to the `EventCenter` and the event will be dispatched to the `BrowserPanel` to load Facebook page. The `ShowFacebookRequestEvent` takes the name of the person specified by the index number as an argument.

As part of the UI component, the `BrowserPanel` class loads the facebook page using a method called `loadFacebookPage`. It handles the dispatched `ShowFacebookRequestEvent` event and calls the `loadFacebookPage` to mount the Facebook Page on the user interface.

The Facebook search page is the mobile version of it. This is because the desktop version of Facebook search page cannot be displayed properly in the BrowsePanel due to some formatting issues.
[NOTE]
The user has to ensure that an internet connection is established to succeed in the command.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Logging in to Facebook through CLI or GUI +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** User enters the command `facebook INDEX` in the command box without his username and password; once the log in page is loaded he will enter his username and password in the page itself.  +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and hassle-free. No need to import Facebook API, just load the page by parsing its URL into the relevant methods. +
**Cons:** Defeats the purpose of a CLI application. User needs to navigate the log in page. +
**Alternative 2:** User enters the command `facebook INDEX`, followed by his username and password in the command box. He is automatically logged into Facebook and is directed to Facebook's newsfeed page.  +
**Pros:** Saves users the trouble of navigating the facebook log in page. Adheres to the purpose of the application having a CLI. +
**Cons:** More difficult to implement. May require the use of Facebook API which may cause unexpected regressions that developers may not know how to solve.
// end::facebookcont[]

// tag::addremovetag[]

=== Add/Remove Tag mechanism

The add/remove tag mechanism is facilitated by the `FilteredList`, which resides in the `ModelManager`. It inherits
from the `UndoableCommand` and is similar to the add/delete person function but deals with tags instead.

The mechanism performs an addition/removal of a tag using a list of target indexes that is within the range of the
default list and a tag to add/remove. By using the `FilteredList`, addition and removal of tags when the list is
unfiltered or filtered by other commands such as the find command is possible. Furthermore tags can be added to/removed
from multiple people at once.

Suppose the user wants to add the tag "friends" to the first two persons in the list. The user will execute the
`AddTagCommand`, addtag 1 2 t/friends, to add the tag "friends" to the 1st and 2nd person in the last person indexing
of UniCity. The same can be done to remove the tags as illustrated by the diagram below:

image::AddRemoveTag.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the given indexes are out of bounds, the `AddTagCommand` and `RemoveTagCommand` will throw an exception

The following sequence diagram shows how the add tag operation works:

image::AddTagSdLogic.png[width="800"]

The remove tag command works in the same way but with a different command name instead.

[NOTE]
If the tag to remove doesn't exist, `RemoveTagCommand` will throw an exception while `AddTagCommand` will throw an
exception if the tag exists in every person in the given list of indexes.

The `addTag` method of the `ModelManager` goes through each person in the list and adds the tag to each of them and
updates them. This works the same for the `removeTag` method. After which it raises the `indicateAddressBookChanged`
event which triggers the storage component to save this change. Note that by indicating an event instead of directly
calling the storage component, coupling is reduced. The implementation of `addTag` is shown below:

[source,java]
----
        /**
             * Adds given tag to the given indexes of the target persons shown in the last person listing.
             */
            @Override
            public synchronized void addTag(ArrayList<Index> targetIndexes, Tag toAdd, String commandWord) throws PersonNotFoundException,
                    DuplicatePersonException {

                for (Index index : targetIndexes) {
                    int targetIndex = index.getZeroBased();
                    ReadOnlyPerson oldPerson = this.getFilteredPersonList().get(targetIndex);

                    Person newPerson = setTagsForNewPerson(oldPerson, toAdd, commandWord);

                    addressBook.updatePerson(oldPerson, newPerson);
                    indicateAddressBookChanged();
                }
            }

----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of the `addTag` and `removeTag` method +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement the methods in `ModelManager`. +
**Pros:**  Easier to implement since `ModelManager` has access to all the required methods and variables. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand how it works as a large amount of code in the many layers of the Model
component must be read to understand the mechanism. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement the `addTag` and `removeTag` method inside `AddTagCommand` and `RemoveTagCommand`
respectively. +
**Pros:** Easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Involves replication of code, violating the DRY principle. Furthermore, it violates the Single Responsibility
Principle and the Separation of Concerns as `AddTagCommand` and `RemoveTagCommand` must now update the person and
raise the address book changed event.

---

**Aspect:** Type of command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement the command as an `UndoableCommand`. +
**Pros:** More intuitive for the user to type undo when he makes the mistake. +
**Cons:** New developers must understand the template pattern before they can understand these commands. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement the command as a normal `Command`. +
**Pros:** Allows the user to undo a previous add/remove by clicking the up button to bring up the previous command and
then changing the first letter since the shortcut command for `AddTagCommand` and `RemoveTagCommand` is "at" and "rt"
respectively. +
**Cons:** Less intuitive for the user and is not consistent with the design that commands that modify data should be
undoable.

// end::addremovetag[]

// tag::find[]

=== Find command closest matching name suggestion mechanism

The closest matching name suggestion mechanism is facilitated by the `getClosestMatchingName` function which resides
inside `ModelManager`. The algorithm used to find the closest matching name is supported by the `JaroWinklerDistance`
function that is imported from the Apaches Commons-Text library.

This feature provides a decently accurate suggestion of the person the user might have been referring to in UniCity.
Furthermore, it shows the results of the suggestion to guide the user further. Suppose that the user has just executed
`FindCommand`, the given name(s) are searched. If a the name is found, the result is shown else the results for the
name that is the most similar is shown instead. This flow can be summarised by activity diagram below.

image::FindCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the given name does not match with any of the names in UniCity, all contacts are shown instead.

The function that facilitates the suggestion feature, `getClosestMatchingName()`, is implemented as shown.

[source,java]
----
        /* JaroWinklerDistance method uses double values ranging from 0 to 1. Set initial value to match very similar
         * names only. Setting the value to any value less than or equal to 0 will match the first name in filteredPersons
         */
        private final double initialToleranceValue = 0.5;

        @Override
            public String getClosestMatchingName(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate) {

                requireNonNull(predicate);
                ArrayList<String> allNames = getListOfAllFirstAndLastNames(predicate);
                List<String> keywords = predicate.getKeywords();
                return keywords.size() == 1 ? getClosestMatchingNameForOneKeyword(keywords, allNames, initialToleranceValue)
                        : getClosestMatchingNameForMultipleKeywords(keywords, allNames, initialToleranceValue);
            }

----


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Level of `initialTolerance` value. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set the level to a predefined value. +
**Pros:**  Only the most relevant results are found and shown. +
**Cons:** Depending on the given level, the checks might too stringent, causing no names to be matched at times. +
**Alternative 2:** Do not set a value for the tolerance level. +
**Pros:** There will definitely be a result. +
**Cons:** No results should be returned for a input that is cannot be matched. For example, if the user were to enter
a phone number as an input, a result will still be returned when no names in UniCity have numbers in them. This
results in varying accuracy when trying to find a match. This uncertainty is unfavourable when accuracy is of higher
priority.


// end::find[]


// tag::windowsize[]

=== Change window size command mechanism

The `ChangeWindowSizeCommand` is an event-driven mechanism. It is complemented by the `WindowSize` model which contains
the data constants and functions related to the `WindowSize`. The sequence of events is as follows. When the user
enters the command to change the window size, the logic component executes the `ChangeWindowSizeCommand`
which in turns posts a `ChangeWindowSizeRequestEvent`. The User Interface component then handles the event
`ChangeWindowSizeCommand`. This can be summarised by the sequence diagram below.

image::SDChangeWindowSize.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Need for `WindowSize` model. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `WindowSize` model exists. +
**Pros:**  Better code quality and it is used by other components in place of the `ChangeWindowSizeCommand`. +
**Cons:**  First time developer must get used to referring to the model instead of the `ChangeWindowSizeCommand` +
**Alternative 2:** All attributes and functions associated with the `WindowSize` model is placed in the
`ChangeWindowSizeCommand`. +
**Pros:** Convenient for first time developers to understand. +
**Cons:** `ChangeWindowSizeCommand` is crowded with too much information that can be abstracted away as another class.
Furthermore, the `ChangeWindowSizeCommand` must be imported unnecessarily when in use by other components, increasing
coupling.

// end::windowsize[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::reply[]
=== Duplicate-checking and reply mechanism for add command

The duplicate-checking mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand` features which resides inside the commands folder of the logic component.
This mechanism checks the user's contacts list for any existing fields that corresponds to the contact information that the user has keyed in when he/she wishes to add a contact.
The algorithm used to find duplicates are supported by the `checkDuplicateField` method in the `AddCommand` class.++

`checkDuplicateField` method relies on the mutable `duplicateFields` and `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_FIELD` String attribute to check for duplicates and inform the user of any duplicate fields;
it checks if `duplicateFields` contains any of the predetermined fields such as name, phone, address and email fields before proceeding to check for any of such duplicate field.
`duplicateFields` only checks a single occurence of the name, phone, address and email duplicate fields. `checkDuplicateField` will stop checking for duplicates for a particular field once
`duplicateFields` already contains that field. The code snippet below further illustrates this point:
[source,java]
----
    private void checkDuplicateField(Person toAdd) throws DuplicatePersonException {

    //some code here..

    if (duplicateFields.contains(NAME_FIELD) && duplicateFields.contains(PHONE_FIELD) &&
        duplicateFields.contains(EMAIL_FIELD) && duplicateFields.contains(ADDRESS_FIELD)) {
            //method found duplicates for all fields, no further concatenation of message. break from loop.
            break;
        }

    /* The following conditional statements checks if duplicateFields already covers, or have yet to cover, any
     * of the fields. It will keep checking the fields which have not been listed as a duplicate until it hits
     * one or the loop ends.
     */

    if (!duplicateFields.contains(NAME_FIELD)) {
        checkDuplicateName(toAdd, contact);
    }

    if (!duplicateFields.contains(PHONE_FIELD)) {
        checkDuplicatePhone(toAdd, contact);

    }

    if (!duplicateFields.contains(ADDRESS_FIELD)) {
        checkDuplicateAddress(toAdd, contact);
    }

    if (!duplicateFields.contains(EMAIL_FIELD)) {
        checkDuplicateEmail(toAdd, contact);
    }

    some code here..

}

----

`checkDuplicateField` is further dissected into methods that check for duplicates for a particular field. A code snippet below is a method to check for duplicate emails:

[source,java]
----
    private void checkDuplicateEmail(Person toAdd, ReadOnlyPerson contact) {
        if ((toAdd.getEmail().toString().trim().equalsIgnoreCase(contact.getEmail().toString().trim()))
                && (!toAdd.getEmail().toString().trim().equals(DEFAULT_EMAIL))) {
            isWaitingforReply = true;
            if (duplicateFields.equals("")) {
                duplicateFields = EMAIL_FIELD;
            } else {
                duplicateFields += ", " + EMAIL_FIELD;
            }
        }
    }
----
A boolean attribute `isWaitingforReply` will be used to check if a `ReplyCommand` is required for this operation. The duplicate-checking methods will set this attribute to true once a duplicate field has been found.
`AddCommand` then returns a prompt for a user reply when it finds that `isWaitingforReply` is set to true. As it prompts the user, `ReplyCommand` holds the `Person` class to be added until the user replys. ++

The user will reply with a `yes` or `no`. This reply is wrapped in the aforementioned `ReplyCommand` class and handles the add feature for duplicate fields. If the user replies with `yes`, `ReplyCommand` will retrieve
the `Person` class it has stored as an attribute and proceed with add command's execution. Should the user reply with `no`, the add command will be discarded.

[NOTE]
The check for duplicate fields are case-insensitve. ie `David Li` will match with `david li` under the name field.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Integration of the reply mechanism +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a class solely for reply itself, called the `ReplyCommand` +
**Pros:**  `ReplyCommand` is abstracted away from `AddCommand` class and could potentially be used for other undoable commands such as `EditCommand` without breaking any abstraction barriers. +
**Cons:** Developers have to make more considerations when planning and implementing the code.
Having a reply command may be insignificant and thus contradicts the actual definition of `Command`; while each commands execute complex, unique actions
and have unique purposes, the reply command merely pauses and repeats the add command according the user's wish. +
**Alternative 2:** Fix the reply mechanism into `AddCommand` +
**Pros:**  This makes it easier for developers to code as all the duplicate-checking and reply mechanism will be in one class. +
**Cons:** This makes it difficult for developers to implement if they decide to include a duplicate-checking and reply mechanism without repeating codes for other commands, such as `EditCommand`.
Also, that would not be ideal in the context of abstraction layers as it could potentially lead to other commands having to penetrate the `AddCommand` abstraction barrier to retrieve the reply mechanism.+

// end::reply[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides
more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the method 3. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* Run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* Run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

Run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire UniCity by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

Refer to <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. Refer to <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives: +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

Path 1: Add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

Path 2: Add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.

** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
