== Introduction

Welcome to the ConTag's Developer Guide! Whether you are a beginner or an expert developer, if you are looking to improve and customise our ConTag application, this is the perfect place to get you started.

This comprehensive guide brings you all the necessary information you need to navigate around ConTag with ease, which includes:

* Step by step guide to set up your project
* Design and implementation of ConTag features

=== Overview of the ConTag Project

ConTag was initially developed to be an efficient and feature-packed desktop address book application for the most demanding business users and busiest frequent travellers.

=== How to Use the Developer Guide

The developer guide contains quite a number of information, so it can be quite intimidating. However, you do not have to read the developer guide in a linear order. Instead, you can use the linked content list at the top of this guide to navigate towards specific issues as needed.

This guide has been organised in a manner that mimics how you would go about developing your features. It starts with setting up your project to documenting your features implementation details, before ending off with additional information, such as User Stories and Glossary.

Finally, as you read the developer guide, you will see these two icons:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates something for you to take note of.

[TIP]
This symbol indicates a tip to help you.

== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites

Before starting your project, make sure that you have all the following:

* *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

* *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ, by default, has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

* Overall *understanding* and *knowledge* of `JAVA`
+
[NOTE]
This application is written in JAVA. +
All example codes in the guide uses JAVA language. +

=== Setting up the Project in Your Computer

. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ IDEA
[NOTE]
If you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first.
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it by clicking `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Windows) or `./gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux)

If everything goes well, it should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. This indicates the generation of all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the Setup

To make sure that the application runs as expected after the initial set up setting up, do the following: *(DO WE NEED THIS LINE? OR HOW CAN WE IMPROVE IT?)*

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to Do Before Writing Code

==== Configuring the Coding Style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours. However, it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux) or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* Set `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'` to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* Configure `Import Layout` to follow the following order. You need to add `<blank line>` in between each `import`:

.. `import static all other imports`
.. `import java.\*`
.. `import javax.*`
.. `import org.\*`
.. `import com.*`
.. `import all other imports`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating Documentation to Match Your Fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repository. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting Started with Coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

This section will provide an overview of the high level architecture system used to design and implement the application , mainly
`Model` , `Logic` , `Storage` and `UI`.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* shown in _Figure 2.1.1_ below explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see _Figure 2.1.2_ below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

_Figure 2.1.3a_ below shows the _Sequence Diagram_ for how the components interact in the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

_Figure 2.1.3b_ below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

As seen from _Figure 2.2.1_ below, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

_Figure 2.3.1_ below shows the structure of the `Logic` component.

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

_Figure 2.3.2_ shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in _Figure 2.3.1_.

image::NewLogicComponentCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component.

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The following is a brief explanation on how the API is implemented:

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

_Figure 2.3.3_ below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

The structure of the `Model` component can be seen in _Figure 2.4.1_ below.

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

image::NewModelComponentClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

=== Storage component

The structure of the `Storage` component can be seen in _Figure 2.5.1_ below.

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

image::NewStorageClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
Each sample code shows the correct sequence of calls and parameters in general implementation of the feature to allow you to perform modification of your own.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. _Figure 4.1.1_ below shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::NewLogicComponentCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Inheritance Diagram for Commands_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way in _Figure 4.1.2_:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----
_Figure 4.1.2 : Code section in ListCommand.java_

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way in _Figure 4.1.3_:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----
_Figure 4.1.3 : Code section in UndoableCommand.java_

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

As depicted in _Figure 4.1.4_: The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4 : UndoRedoStack Diagram 1_

As depicted in _Figure 4.1.5_: As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.5 : UndoRedoStack Diagram 2_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

As depicted in _Figure 4.1.6_: We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.6 : UndoRedoStack Diagram 3_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The sequence diagram in _Figure 4.1.7_ below shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.7 : Undo sequence diagram_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

As depicted in _Figure 4.1.8_: The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.8 : UndoRedoStack Diagram 4_

As depicted in _Figure 4.1.9_: Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.9 : UndoRedoStack Diagram 5_

The following activity diagram in _Figure 4.1.10_ below summarizes what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.10 : UndoRedoStack Activity Diagram_

==== Design Considerations for `UndoableCommand`

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`. +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Displaying the Usage of a Specific Command [Since v1.2]

This function is an enhancement of the exisitng help function, which opens the help command. The modification allows the help command to take in an optional command identifier argument. If the command identifier is specified, the result display will display the usage of the command specified. Otherwise, help window will be opened. This enhancement requires modifications in the Model and Logic components of the application.

For the Model component, `CommandIdentifier` is implemented this way in _Figure 4.2.1_:
[source,java]
----
public class CommandIdentifier {

    // ... required public static final fields ...

    public CommandIdentifier(String commandIdentifier) throws IllegalValueException {
        requireNonNull(commandIdentifier);
        if (!isValidCommandIdentifier(commandIdentifier) && !commandIdentifier.equals("")) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_COMMAND_WORD_CONSTRAINTS);
        }
        this.value = commandIdentifier;
    }

    public static boolean isValidCommandIdentifier(String test) {
       // ... checks if the string argument is a valid command identifier ...
    }
}
----
_Figure 4.2.1: Code section in CommandIdentifier.java_
[NOTE]
A valid command identifier includes all existing command and their aliases.

For the Logic component, when the user key in help command in the command box, `HelpCommandParser` will be called. It parses user input that folows the help command, which may contain the optional command identifier argument, as shown in _Figure 4.2.2_:
[source,java]
----
public HelpCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    // ... checks if the argument contains at most 1 word ...

    // ... calls ParserUtil to parse command identifier ...

    // ... calls HelpCommand ...
}
----
_Figure 4.2.2: Code section in HelpCommandParser.java_

To accomodate this enhancement, the following method is added into `ParserUtil`. The method takes in user input string and return a `CommandIdentifier` object, as shown in _Figure 4.2.3_:
[source,java]
----
public static CommandIdentifier parseCommandIdentifier(String commandWord) throws IllegalValueException {
    requireNonNull(commandWord);
    return new CommandIdentifier(commandWord.trim());
}
----
_Figure 4.2.3: Code section in ParserUtil.java_

Finally, the `CommandIdentifier` is passed into `HelpCommand` to do the command execution. The execute method in the `HelpCommand` is implemented as follows in _Figure 4.2.4_:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() {
    // ... switch cases for all the command words and command aliases ...

    // ... default case: opens help window ...
}
----
_Figure 4.2.4: Code section in HelpCommand.java_

The `HelpCommand` execution is done in `AddressBookParser`. _Figure 4.2.5_ below shows the output of this function.

image::HelpEnhancementScreenShot.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.5 : Output of `HelpCommand` execution_

//tag::locate[]
=== Locating a contact's address [Since v1.2]

This function is mainly facilitated by two events: `JumpToListRequestEvent` and `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent`.

When the LocateCommand is being executed, after checking that the target index is valid, a new `JumpToListRequestEvent` is posted by the `EventsCenter` class to its `EventBus`, as shown in _Figure 4.3.1_:
[source,java]
----
public class LocateCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

        //... check targetIndex ...

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new JumpToListRequestEvent(targetIndex));

        //... return CommandResult ...
    }
}
----
_Figure 4.3.1: Code section in LocateCommand.java_

The UI part `PersonListPanel` is in charge of handling this event (i.e.`JumpToListRequestEvent`) , and does so by scrolling to the contact of the corresponding index and selecting it, as shown in _Figure 4.3.2_:
[source,java]
----
public class PersonListPanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    /**
     * Scrolls to the {@code PersonCard} at the {@code index} and selects it.
     */
    private void scrollTo(int index) {
        Platform.runLater(() -> {
            personListView.scrollTo(index);
            personListView.getSelectionModel().clearAndSelect(index);
        });
    }

    // Handling method for JumpToListRequestEvent
    @Subscribe
    private void handleJumpToListRequestEvent(JumpToListRequestEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        scrollTo(event.targetIndex);
    }
}
----
_Figure 4.3.2: Code section in PersonListPanel.java_

The UI outcome of scrolling and selecting a `PersonCard` in the `PersonListPanel` is shown in Figure 4.3.3 below:

image::PersonListPanelSelect.png[width="400"]
_Figure 4.3.3 : UI outcome of scrolling and selecting a `PersonCard`_

When the constructor of `PersonListPanel` class is called, it will add a listener to the personListView which consists of a list view of each `PersonCard`. This listener ensures that a new `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` will be raised when a new item in the list view is being selected. This can be shown below in _Figure 4.3.4_:
[source,java]
----
public class PersonListPanel extends UiPart<Region> {

    public PersonListPanel(ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> personList) {
        super(FXML);
        setConnections(personList); // calls addListenerForSelectionChangeEvent() method
        registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
    }

     /**
     * Creates a list of {@code PersonCard} from {@code personList}, sets them to the {@code personListView}
     * and adds listener to {@code personListView} for selection change.
     */
    private void setConnections(ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> personList) {
        //... set up personListView with personList ...
        addListenerForSelectionChangeEvent();
    }

    /**
     * Adds a listener to {@code personListView} so that
     * selected item raises {@code PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent}.
     */
    private void addListenerForSelectionChangeEvent() {
        personListView.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty()
                .addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -> {
                    if (newValue != null) {
                        logger.fine("Selection in person list panel changed to : '" + newValue + "'");
                        raise(new PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(newValue));
                    }
                });
    }
}
----
_Figure 4.3.4: Code section 2 in PersonListPanel.java_

The `BrowserPanel` contains a `WebView` which displays a web page of the google map location of the selected person's address. It is able to do so as it is an event subscriber for the `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` as shown below in _Figure 4.3.5_:
[source,java]
----
public class BrowserPanel extends UiPart<Region> {

    @Subscribe
    private void handleSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) throws IllegalValueException {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadPersonPage(event.getNewSelection().person);
    }
}
----
_Figure 4.3.5: Code section in BrowserPanel.java_

By being a subscriber to this event, the `WebView` in `BrowserPanel` will load the corresponding web page whenever a new
`PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is posted to the `EventBus`. _Figure 4.3.6_ below shows the full UI outcome of selecting a selecting a `PersonCard` in the `PersonListPanel`, as well as displaying the corresponding address location in `BrowserPanel`.

_Figure 4.3.6 : Full UI outcome of locate implementation_

==== Design Considerations for `LocateCommand`

**Aspect:** Execution of `LocateCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Posts a new `JumpToListRequestEvent` to `EventBus`. +
**Pros:** `PersonCard` in `PersonListPanel` will be selected as shown in the UI, before location on Google Maps is displayed in `BrowserPanel`. Hence, the user will be able to see clearly the contact that is associated with the located address. +
**Cons:** Future developers will have to change execution of `LocateCommand` if they plan for to implement more useful events for card selection in `PersonListPanel`. +
**Alternative 2:** Post a new event directly for `BrowserPanel` to handle. +
**Pros:** Makes way for future implementations involving the selection in `PersonListPanel`. +
**Cons:** User will not able to view contact's location when a `PersonCard` is manually selected.

// end::locate[]

//tag::FindCommand[]
=== FindCommand by any search field [Since v1.2]


The find function `FindCommand` which reside in `Logic` will support the search of contact by any keywords. The keywords must be a full word match.The find function only deals with existing parameters `Name`, `Email`, `Address`, `Phone` and `Tags`. Such parameters inherit from `Person` which resides inside `Model`.


`Find Command` will only execute when the prefix of the parameters is given. Any other prefix as input will be considered as invalid input. Checks will be conducted via `FindCommandParser` which inherits from `FindCommand`, as shown in _Figure 4.4.1_.

[source,java]
----
public class FindCommandParser implements Parser<FindCommand> {
    public FindCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        requireNonNull(args);
        ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
                ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_ADDRESS, PREFIX_TAG);
    //...Check for allocation of Predicate...
    }
}

----
_Figure 4.4.1: Code section in FindCommandParser.java_

[NOTE]
A valid find command can only search for keywords based on specific prefix  [n/NAME] or [p/PHONE] or [e/EMAIL] or [a/ADDRESS] or [t/TAG]

Also,the input will first have to be tokenised in order to extract the prefix for for the search procedure. In absence of valid prefix ,an exception will be thrown, as shown in _Figure 4.4.2_.
[source,java]
----
        if (!areSomePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_ADDRESS, PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_TAG)) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, FindCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
----
_Figure 4.4.2: Code section 2 in FindCommandParser.java_

A successful tokenism of the prefix will ensure that the keywords are  allocated to  method `containsKeyWordPredicate` under `Model` . The methods takes in the user input and returns a `containsKeyWordPredicate`. Addressbook will search for the keywords in the revelvant parameters.

Upon any successful match, the particulars of the contact will be displayed. _Figures 4.4.3a to 4.4.3e_ below indicate the various outcomes of search function by  using `FindCommand` .

==== Design Considerations for `FindCommand`


**Aspect:** Enhancement of `FindCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Searching for contact based on the `prefix` of search field given. +
**Pros:** To brings about greater convenience for the user during the searching process. User no longer not restricted to find contact by name soley. +
**Cons:** User have to be know the various `prefixes` in order to be able to search for the contract via the attribute of the contact. +
**Alternative 2:** Searching for contact without having the need to input prefix +
**Pros:** Easier for users to find a contact without the hassle to have full knowledge of the various `prefixes`. Might be more intuitive for user. +
**Cons:** Have to look through all the attribute of contact thus slowing down FindCommand. +

---

//tag::CopyCommand[]
=== Copy email address to clipboard [Since v1.2]

The `copy` function uses the Clipboard in Toolkit API to automatically copy emails of selected indexes onto the system clipboard.
The index(es) selected must exist in the current result display window, as shown in _Figure 4.5.1_.

[source,java]
----
// copy string to clipboard
Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
Clipboard clipboard = toolkit.getSystemClipboard();
StringSelection messageOutputSelection = new StringSelection(messageOutput);
clipboard.setContents(messageOutputSelection, null);

----
_Figure 4.5.1: Code section in CopyCommand.java_

The selected emails are stored in a string ArrayList, then re-formatted to remove square brackets around the ArrayList and change all commas to semi-colons before sending the result to system clipboard output, as shown in _Figure 4.5.2_ below. This ensures that the final output string copied to clipboard has maximum compatibility with formatting conventions in email applications.

[source,java]
----
// outputList without square brackets
String messageOutput = outputList.toString().substring(1, outputList.toString().length() - 1);

// outputList use semi-colon separator
messageOutput = messageOutput.replace(",", ";");

----
_Figure 4.5.2: Code section 2 in CopyCommand.java_

_Figures 4.5.3a and 4.5.3b_ below show examples of copy command on display in the UI, showing the acceptable format for indexes, and the expected result. Note that the message will only be displayed if the message is already copied to the system clipboard.:

_Figure 4.5.3b : Copy from multiple contacts_

_Figure 4.5.4_ below shows an applied use of this command in an e-mail application--addresses automatically detected upon clipboard paste

image::CopyCommand_browser_result.PNG[width="400"]
_Figures 4.5.4: Applied use of command in email application_

==== Design Considerations for `CopyCommand`



Why it is implemented that way

There was no way to copy emails from the listed contacts in the previous version, so a user would have to refer to the address book application while typing it into their email application or browser manually. As email addresses are almost always meant to be utilized in an electronic device, an automatic ‘copy’ command of all requested email addresses is the most efficient and user-friendly way of text selection for this type of information.

Alternatives considered

It is possible to provide the same output text in the console message to user, which was the first iteration of this feature. However, since the resultant string was only meant to be copied either way, this implementation would cause the user to perform one more action per email address output request, as they would have to manually copy the output to their system clipboard.

Alternatively, it may also be possible to permanently display all fields in each contact listing as selectable text. However, this means that the user is required to select each line of text via user interface rather than command line, which contradicts a core requirement of the project.

//tag::CalendarCommand[]
=== Opening Calendar [Since v1.3]

`CalendarCommand` which reside in `Logic` will  open up a new browser webpage in the `BrowserPanel` that shows calendar for the entire year. The webpage will display the calendar from January to December, inclusive of public holidays. Upon taking in `CalendarCommand`  in the command line, a new `ShowCalendarRequestEvent` is posted by the `EventsCenter` class to its `EventBus`, as shown in _Figure 4.6.1_:. In addition , user are bypass `CalendarCommand` by pressing on `F2` key to post `ShowCalendarRequestEvent` thus allow user to launch calendar webpage via command line or via accelerators.

[source,java]
----
public class CalendarCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowCalendarRequestEvent());
      //  return new CommandResult
    }
}

----
_Figure 4.6.1: Code section in CalendarCommand.java_


The  `BrowserPanel`  which reside in `UI` will handle the event of `ShowCalendarRequestEvent`
as shown in _Figure 4.6.2_:
[source,java]
----
public class BrowserPanel extends UiPart<Region> {
@Subscribe
    private void handleCalendarRequestEvent(ShowCalendarRequestEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadCalendar();
   }
}
----
_Figure 4.6.2: Code section in BrowserPanel.java_

The method `loadCalendar` will pass the calendar url to `BrowserPanel` to open up calendar website in `BrowserPanel`. The outcome of successful launching of calendar webpage in browser is shown in _Figure 4.6.3_:

==== Design Considerations for `FindCommand`


**Aspect:** Implementationt of `CalendarCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Opening  `Calendar` webpage in `BrowserPanel`. +
**Pros:** To brings about greater convenience for the user as user does not need to navigate between multple webpages to find the calendar.User are able to find out about the public holidays which are not avaliable on desktop calendar. +
**Cons:** User might bypass the `CalendarCommand` and rely on desktop calendar +
**Alternative 2:** Opening up of google calendar +
**Pros:** User are able to store the events in the google calendar. +
**Cons:** Unable to view public holidays.User also have to go through the hassle of logging in just to view the calendar. +

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

The logging levels used in this project include:

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

This section indicates the type of file we use for writing documentation.
We will be using asciidoc for writing documentation.


*Advatnages of using  asciidoc over Markdown:*

* asciidoc uses the same number of markup characters or less when compared to Markdown in nearly all cases.

* asciidoc uses a consistent formatting scheme (i.e., it has consistent patterns).

* asciidoc can handle all permutations of nested inline (and block) formatting, whereas Markdown often falls down.

* asciidoc handles cases that Markdown doesn’t, such as a proper approach to inner-word markup, source code blocks and block-level images.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.
asciidoc also supports a broader range of syntax than Markdown.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in _Figure 4.4.1_ below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

This section covers the various testing framework adopted for this application.
Testing is essential for quality assurance, verification and validation.
There are three ways to run tests in this application.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing

**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section introduce the various tools adopted for building, testing and releasing of application.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

The following is a suggestion for the local enhancement in the `Logic` component:

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

The following is a suggestion for the local enhancement in the `Model` component:

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

The following are some suggestions for the local enhancements in the `Ui` component:

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red. The before and after screenshots can be seen in _Figure A.1.1a_ and _Figure A.1.1b_ below.

+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
