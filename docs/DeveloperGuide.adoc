== About

This developer guide provides developers working on the KayPoh application an in-depth explanation
of how the application works. A working knowledge of UML diagram notation and familiarity with the Java programming
language will be helpful in understanding the implementation details discussed in this guide.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1: Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter`: This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter`: Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*]: The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*]: The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*]: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*]: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2: Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1: Structure of the UI Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1: Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1: Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1: Structure of the Model Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1: Structure of the Storage Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

_Figure 3.1.1: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

_Figure 3.1.2: Interactions inside Logic Component for the `undo` Command_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

_Figure 3.1.3: Flow of activities inside `UndoRedoStack`_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::multiplephonenumbers[]
=== Multiple Fields

When an `AddCommandParser` or `EditCommandParser` is used to parse a command, an `ArgumentMultimap` object is created which contains a hashmap mapping the prefixes to a list of their respective arguments.

The `ArgumentMultimap` class has a `getValue` method and a `getMultipleValues` method. If there are multiple strings passed as arguments to the prefix, the `getValue` method returns only the last string in the list, while the `getMultipleValues` returns a concatenation of all the strings in the list.

image::multipleFieldsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `ParserUtil` class has various parsing methods, such as `parseName` and `parsePhone`. The method `parseName` returns a `Name` object wrapped in the `Optional` class and the method returns a `Phone` object wrapped in the `Optional` class.

The `parsePhone` method in the `ParserUtil` class calls the `getMultipleValues` method of the `ArgumentMultimap` class instead of the `getValue` method called by the other parsers. This allows multiple phone numbers to be stored in a `Phone` object.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Display of the multiple phone numbers +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Insert a newline character ("\n") between different phone numbers. +
**Pros:** Easier to see the different phone numbers. +
**Cons:** Less flexibility in adding multiple phone numbers (cannot type `p/12345 56789`). +
**Alternative 2:** Insert a space character (" ") between different phone numbers. +
**Pros:** More flexibility in adding multiple phone numbers. Can type type `p/12345 56789` to add the two phone numbers with only one "p/" prefix. +
**Cons:** Harder to see the different phone numbers, makes the display more cluttered. +

**Aspect:** Initialising of `Phone` object +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Constructor of `Phone` takes in a String as parameter, modify current constructor. +
**Pros:** No need to create a new method. +
**Cons:** Not so easy to manipulate the string and split the multiple phone numbers. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a new constructor for `Phone` that takes in a List<String> as parameter. +
**Pros:** Easier to manipulate the multiple phone numbers in the list. +
**Cons:** Can cause problems during testing as there are two constructors. +

**Aspect:** Allowing duplicate phone numbers for a contact +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do not allow duplicate phone numbers. +
**Pros:** Makes the address book more usable. +
**Cons:** Need to implement checking of the arguments. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow duplicate phone numbers. +
**Pros:** No need to check whether the arguments have been entered already. +
**Cons:** May cause the address book to be messy if adding duplicate phone numbers was not the user's intention. +

**Aspect:** Dealing with invalid values as well as valid values +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accept valid values and ignore invalid values. +
**Pros:** Makes it easier for the user as the invalid value may have been an accident and the valid value may actually be correct. +
**Cons:** Both values may have been incorrect and an incorrect phone number would have been added. +
**Alternative 2:** Ignore all values as long as there is one invalid value. +
**Pros:** No need to continue checking the rest of the arguments once there is one invalid value. +
**Cons:** The incorrect value may have been an accident and the user may want the valid value to be added as a phone number to the contact. +
// end::multiplephonenumbers[]

// tag::facebook[]
=== Facebook Post Mechanism

The Facebook Commands are facilitated by the Facebook Graph API and utilised through the Facebook4j unofficial public API.
Facebook4j supports all facebook related features such as `facebookconnect` and `facebookpost`.

The Facebook Graph API first required us to set up a Facebook Application on the Facebook for developers website. We did so following this link:https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register/#create-app[`guide`].

Completing the creation led to a page as shown below:

.Facebook Application setup page
image::facebook_developers_app.png[width="800"]

Since our AddressBook application is, for now, hosted on a private environment and not a website, we need to authenticate `Testers` on the developers platform as follows:

.Facebook Application testers configuration page
image::facebook_dashboard_testers.png[width="800"]

The Facebook4j API requires us to build a Gradle dependency in the `gradle.properties` file:

----
compile group: 'org.facebook4j', name: 'facebook4j-core', version: '2.4.10'
----

Once the above have been set up, we need to attain a user access key from Facebook through a Facebook Login. This is done through a browser.

Once the access key has been attained, we then set the application credentials in the `facebook4j.properties` and `FacebookConnectCommand.java` files respectively as follows:

----
debug=true
oauth.appId=*************
oauth.appSecret=***********************
----

----
facebookInstance = new FacebookFactory().getInstance();
facebookInstance.setOAuthPermissions(commaSeparetedPermissions);
facebookInstance.setOAuthAccessToken(new AccessToken(accessToken, null));
----

Lastly, we simply post the status to Facebook through the authenticated `facebookInstance` using the following code:

----
Facebook facebookInstance = FacebookConnectCommand.getFacebookInstance();
facebookInstance.postStatusMessage(toPost);
----

The following diagram displays a summary of the entire process, using `facebookpost` as an example:

.Sequence diagram detailing execution of a `facebookpost` command
image::facebook_post_sequence_diagram.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Choice of Facebook API Wrapper (Java) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Facebook4j` wrapper +
**Pros:** User friendly API, well documented. +
**Cons:** Less available online support. +
**Alternative 2:**  Use `Restfb` wrapper +
**Pros:** Easily available online support. +
**Cons:** API is well documented, however less user friendly and functionalities compared to Facebook4j.

---

**Aspect:** How User is authenticated +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Manually login to Facebook using the browser +
**Pros:** Easier to implement given the intended environment of the application (private host rather than website) +
**Cons:** May not be authenticated to use a few Facebook API functions +
**Alternative 2:** Host the entire application on a website and attain Facebook approval. +
**Pros:** Have full access to most features and functions of Graph API +
**Cons:** As Facebook has a very strict criteria for all their applications, preparing the application for approval requires a lot of work that includes proper hosting, implementing SSH protection, having a privacy and terms document, etc.

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of Facebook commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each Facebook [COMMAND] is task oriented, e.g. Facebook connect, Facebook post, etc. +
**Pros:** Modular, all commands are separate and taken as blackbox although there are dependencies. +
**Cons:** Increase in possible dependencies in the software, like how most will depend on `Facebook connect`. +
**Alternative 2:** Ensure each command is stand-alone and fully independent +
**Pros:** Will have less dependencies. +
**Cons:** May incur more code overhead and make the software less 'lean'. +

// end::facebook[]

// tag::social-media-accounts[]
=== Social Media Accounts

Information about contact's social media accounts are encapsulated by the `SocialInfo` class. The list of `SocialInfos` associated
with a `Person` is handled by the `UniqueSocialInfoList`, which guarantees that at most one of each type of social media type is
associated with the contact.

The following class diagram represents the relationship between the `Person`, `UniqueSocialInfoList` and `SocialInfo` classes:

.Class diagram representing relationships between Person, UniqueSocialInfoList and SocialInfo classes
image::SocialInfoClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Parsing inputs representing social media accounts

The form `SOCIAL_TYPE_IDENTIFIER USERNAME` is used to represent a `SocialInfo` as a parameter in a CLI command.
The `SocialInfoMapping` class handles the mapping between the input `SOCIAL_TYPE_IDENTIFER` and the url format of the associated social media platform.
A `Collection` of these raw social info parameters can be passed to the `parseSocialInfo` method in the `SocialInfoMapping` class for parsing.

The following sequence diagram shows how input `rawSocialInfos` are parsed to obtain the appropriate `SocialInfos`:

.Sequence diagram detailing how inputs are parsed to form SocialInfos
image::ParseSocialInfoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
As far as possible instantiation of new `SocialInfo` classes should be handled by the `SocialInfoMapping` class.
The url structures for social media platforms are an external dependency that we do not have control over, thus it is
inevitable that some issues will inevitably arise due to changes in these external dependencies.
It is hence essential to isolate the logic pertaining to the generation of these urls so that any issues can easily be identified and resolved.

==== Adding support for new social media platforms

Handling for parsing inputs for new social platforms should be done by adding the following methods to the `SocialInfoMapping` class.

[source,java]
----
// The input parameter has been split into two parts - the socialType and the username

private static boolean isPlatformInfo(String[] splitRawSocialInfo) {
       // ... Check if the platform is identified by the input social info
    }

private static SocialInfo buildPlatformInfo(String[] splitRawSocialInfo) {
    // ... Parse the url representing the social media feed using the platform and username
    // ... Instantiate the SocialInfo represented by the platform, username, and url
}
----

and then adding the following logic to the `parseSocialInfos` method:

[source,java]
----
public static SocialInfo parseSocialInfo(String rawSocialInfo) throws IllegalValueException {
    // ... initialization logic here

    if (isFacebookInfo(splitRawSocialInfo)) {
        return buildFacebookInfo(splitRawSocialInfo);
    }

    // ... other social platforms here

    } else if (isPlatformInfo(splitRawSocialInfo)) {
        return buildPlatformInfo(splitRawSocialInfo);
    }

    // ... other social platforms here

    } else {
        throw new IllegalValueException(UNRECOGNIZED_SOCIAL_TYPE_MESSAGE);
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `SocialInfo` class +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Have a class that handles information for all social media platforms. +
**Pros:** Simple schema that is easily marshalled/unmarshalled by the JAXB library used by the storage component. +
**Cons:** Assumes that all social media platforms can be represented by the username and the url to the user's page.
Can be difficult to extend to contain more attributes for social platforms that may need them. +
**Alternative 2:** Have an abstract class that handles must-have information for all social media platforms,
which classes designed for each social platform will extend. +
**Pros:** More flexibility in extending the class to suit the needs of social media types. +
**Cons:** Difficult to handle marshalling/unmarshalling to XML format using the JAXB library.
Adds significant complexity to the codebase when number of supported platforms grow. +
**Additional Info:** An assessment of the major social media platforms shows that the username is sufficient to identify
users on all the major platforms at present. The first alternative was thus selected to ensure complexity of the codebase
remains manageable as support for more social media platforms is added.

---

**Aspect:** Detection of duplicate social types in `UniqueSocialInfoList` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Upon every addition of a `SocialInfo` to the list, iterate through each element in the
existing list to ensure that there are no duplicates. +
**Pros:** No delay on startup. Computation is performed only on demand. +
**Cons:** Slight delay may occur upon every operation that involves addition of a `SocialInfo` to a `UniqueSocialInfoList`
if the number of social platforms supported is high. +
**Alternative 2:** Precompute the HashSet for every `UniqueSocialInfoList` which contains the social types of each `SocialInfo` in the list
upon loading from data file. +
**Pros:** No delay on addition of a `SocialInfo` to a `UniqueSocialInfoList`. +
**Cons:** Possible delay when starting up the application if number of contacts or number of social platforms supported is high.
Additional space required to support storing the HashSets in memory. +
**Additional Info:** Number of social platforms is expected to be a reasonable amount, and thus should not cause much noticable delay.
In comparison, the startup delay may be more significant when a large number of contacts are present in the address book. Thus the first
alternative was selected to provide a more pleasant user experience.
// end::social-media-accounts[]

// tag::command-syntax[]
[[command-options]]
=== Command Options

As some functionalities have similar behaviours, we group them under a single `COMMAND_WORD` and allow the user to include
`OPTIONS` when using the command to specify which functionality is to be executed.

The following command syntax is thus adopted: `COMMAND_WORD [-OPTIONS]... [PARAMETERS]...`, where:

* The `COMMAND_WORD` specifies the *action to be performed*,
* `OPTIONS` are prefixed with a dash (e.g. `-tag`) and specifies *how the action is to be performed*, and
* `PARAMETERS` provide *information for the action to be executed with*.

==== Handling Options

Arguments that may include options should be wrapped with the `OptionBearingArgument` class, which abstracts the parsing
of options and parameters. The following code snippet shows how the `OptionBearingArgument` may be used to parse user inputs:

[source,java]
----
// assume that args is a string containing user input with both arguments and parameters
OptionBearingArgument opArg = new OptionBearingArgument(args);
// options are returned in the form of a set which contains options that are present in the argument
Set<String> options = opArg.getOptions();
// the options are stripped from the argument to give us the parameters
String parameters = opArg.getFilteredArgs();
----

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How commands with similar behaviour should be handled +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Group these commands under a single `COMMAND_WORD` and introduce a new `OPTIONS` syntax
to allow the user to specify the desired functionality to be executed. +
**Pros:** Clear distinction between arguments that specify how a command should be executed, and arguments that provide information
for the command to be executed with. +
**Cons:** Potentially more initial confusion for the user as there is an additional syntax to learn. To mitigate this a
section explaining the updated command syntax has been added to the user guide. +
**Alternative 2:** Group these commands under a single `COMMAND_WORD`, and use the existing `PREFIX/` syntax to identify
how a command should be executed. +
**Pros:** User does not need to learn additional syntax. +
**Cons:** The meaning of the `PREFIX/` syntax becomes unintuitive. This syntax is currently used to denote a property
in an object (i.e. `p/` denotes a phone number in a person). To extend this syntax to command modifiers makes it confusing
for the user as the meaning of the syntax becomes diluted. An informal survey conducted with our target users confirms
that this approach was less intuitive to them compared to the approach described in Alternative 1. +
**Alternative 3:** Have separate `COMMAND_WORDS` for each command. +
**Pros:** Simple syntax, with no confusion over what behaviour will be executed. +
**Cons:** Does not scale well as users have to remember many different commands as the number of features grow.

=== Favoriting Contacts

The favorite status of each contact is stored as a `boolean`, encapsulated within the `Favorite` class. +
There are several ways to toggle this `boolean` to change the favorite status of a contact.

.Favorite is one of the members in the Person class
image::person-class-diagram-favorite.png[width="800"]

==== Toggle favorites using `add` and/or `edit` command +
For user's convenience, we are allowing just the input of prefixes i.e. `f/` in `add` command and either `f/` or `uf/` in `edit` command to make a change to a contact's favorite status.

As such, at `Parser` level in both `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser`, we simply need to know whether the prefixes are present in the user input. Prefixes in user input can be found in `ArgumentMultimap argMultimap`. Hence, we can utilise the following helper-method by passing in `PREFIX_FAV` or `PREFIX_UNFAV` to return true if the prefix is contained within the user input, false otherwise:
[source,java]
----
public boolean isPrefixPresent(Prefix prefix) {
    return argMultimap.containsKey(prefix);
}
----

The helper-method above is called within a common method `parseFavorite` (shown below), used by both `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` classes. The difference in utilisation of the following method by both classes is in the parameters that are passed in. As `AddCommandParser` only needs to check whether `PREFIX_FAV` exists, it will pass in `parseFavorite(argMultimap, PREFIX_FAV, null)` while `EditCommandParser` will pass in `parseFavorite(argMultimap, PREFIX_FAV, PREFIX_UNFAV)` to check for both prefixes.
[source,java]
----
public static Optional<Favorite> parseFavorite(ArgumentMultimap argMultimap,
                                     Prefix prefixFav,
                                     Prefix prefixUnFav) throws ParseException {
    // ... parser logic ...
}
----

For editing person, after obtaining the presence of prefix in user input, we need to perform some input validation by disallowing both `f/` and `uf/` prefixes to be present at the same time. We can check this by using the he:
[source,java]
----
    // Disallow both f/ and uf/ to be present in the same instance of user input when editing
    if (argMultimap.isPrefixPresent(prefixFav) && argMultimap.isPrefixPresent(prefixUnFav)) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
                            EditCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
----

For both adding and editing person, there is a similar validation for disallowing text after prefix e.g. `f/this is a text`. This is achieved by checking whether the any additional `String` exists after prefix.
[source,java]
----
    if (argMultimap.isPrefixPresent(prefixFav)) {
        if (!argMultimap.getValue(prefixFav).get().isEmpty()) { // Disallow text after prefix
            throw new ParseException(Favorite.MESSAGE_FAVORITE_CONSTRAINTS);
        } else {
            return Optional.of(new Favorite(true));
        }
    }
----

// end::favorite[]

// tag::favorite-command[]
==== Toggle favorites using `fav` and/or `unfav` command

To enhance contact management, we implemented these commands to perform batch favoriting or unfavoriting of multiple contacts. They are also capable of performing the operations on a single contact. The implementation involves two major steps.

The first step to doing so is to allow parsing of multiple indexes so that a user could specify which contacts they would like to favorite or unfavorite i.e. `fav 1 2 3`. In this case, we use `List` to parse and store every index.
[source,java]
----
public static List<Index> parseMultipleIndexes(String args) throws IllegalValueException {
    List<String> argsList = Arrays.asList(args.trim().split("\\s+"));
    List<Index> indexList = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String index : argsList) {
        indexList.add(parseIndex(index));
    }
    return indexList;
}
----
Note that trimming `args.trim()` is required since the args passed will usually contain a leading whitespace. The regex `args.trim().split("\\s+")` is used as a form of validation to ignore multiple trailing whitespaces and still allowing such user input to be parsed, preventing an `exception`.

The last step is to create a copy of the person we are favoriting or unfavoriting and change its favorite status via the aforementioned `boolean`. Since the `Person` class takes two constructors, the following constructor allows creating a copy of a given `ReadOnlyPerson`.
[source,java]
----
public Person(ReadOnlyPerson source) {
    // ... create copy of all fields ...
}
----
After getting the copy of the person e.g. `personToFavorite`, it is easy to call `personToFavorite.setFavorite(new Favorite(true))` and that sets the person as a favorite. Batch operation of favoriting or unfavoriting multiple contacts simply loops this last step for the amount of indexes specified by the user.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storing of favorite status +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store it as a `boolean` +
**Pros:** Saves memory, more efficient to call `isFavorite()` to check whether a person is a favorite contact +
**Cons:** Unable to check for `null` or use any other values apart from `true` or `false` +
**Alternative 2:** Store it as a `String` +
**Pros:** Easier for printing its values +
**Cons:** Requires input validation for `String`, less efficient in checking whether a person is a favorite contact (`O(N)` in the worse case scenario)

**Aspect:** Ways to change the favorite status of a person +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allowing favoriting and unfavoriting of contacts through adding and editing persons as well as through `fav` and `unfav` commands +
**Pros:** Creates a more consistent workflow for our user that ties in with other fields, a more straight-foward approach to indicate which are the favorite contacts upon adding a person +
**Cons:** More tedious implementation +
**Alternative 2:** Just rely on `fav` and `unfav` commands +
**Pros:** Easier implementation +
**Cons:** User would have to remember more commands and their usages
// end::favorite-command[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting Contacts
To make it easier for users to find contacts, the displayed person list is kept sorted. Users can specify how contacts
are to be ordered in the list using the `sort` command.

The sorting logic makes use of the Observer pattern. Instead of keeping the `personList` itself sorted, a `SortedList`
backed by the `personList` is constructed. The `SortedList` keeps a list of persons equivalent to that of the `personList`
in sorted order, and ensures that it remains sorted even as changes are made to the underlying `personList`.

This `SortedList` is in turn observed by the `FilteredList` to ensure that the list remains in sorted order even as filters are applied.

The above relationship is represented by the following class diagram:

.Class diagram representing the Observer pattern used to keep contacts in sorted order
image::SortObserverClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

KayPoh! allows the user to sort the person list in several ways. To prevent the user from having to remember a separate
`COMMAND_WORD` for each of these sort commands, we allow these sort commands to share a single `COMMAND_WORD` by having them
inherit from an abstract `SortCommand` class, and introducing <<command-options, Command Options>> to allow the user to specify the sorting order
to be used instead.

.Class diagram representing how the `sort` commands are implemented
image::SortCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Each class that inherits from the `SortCommand` would then implement the `getComparator` method, which returns a
`Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>` to be used by the parent `SortCommand` to define the ordering for the `SortedList`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Where sorting should be handled +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Handle sorts at the `ModelManager` level using the Observer pattern +
**Pros:** Sorting is performed on an in-memory list decoupled from the data file, and hence does not require IO operations which are
computationally more expensive compared to in-memory operations. +
**Cons:** Slightly longer startup time might be observed as the data file is not sorted and hence has to be sorted upon every startup. +
**Alternative 2:** Handle sorts at the `AddressBook` level by sorting the `personList` directly +
**Pros:** Startup might be faster as the data file should have already been sorted. Also reduces complexity of the `Model`
as there is no need to maintain any additional data structures. +
**Cons:** As the `personList` is supposed to mirror the data file, every sort operation will involve updating the data file
in order to keep it in sync with the `personList`. This requires IO operations that are slower compared
to in-memory operations.

---

**Aspect:** How to implement different `sort` commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have an abstract `SortCommand` class with an abstract `getComparator` function to
allow the inheriting classes to define the `Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>` to be used to sort the displayed person list. +
**Pros:** Significantly reduces code duplication, and makes introducing new `sort` commands easy. +
**Cons:** Assumes that all `sort` commands will have similar behavior, differing only in the `Comparator` used for sorting. +
**Alternative 2:**  Have separate commands for each `sort` command. +
**Pros:** More flexibility in how each `sort` command is implemented should requirements change in the future. +
**Cons:** If `sort` commands have similar behavior, then there will be significant amounts of code duplication. +
// end::sort[]

// tag::enhance-ui[]
=== Enhancing User Interface

==== Removing Window Decorations

To enhance our user's satisfaction with KayPoh, we improved the user interface by redesigning the color scheme and allowed theming for user to switch between two available themes.

The first step to adding a better look was to remove the standard platform window decorations. This will shift the application's user interface from classic to a fancier look that is self-contained, without wasting extra pixels just for the default window decorations. This is done by the following code:

----
primaryStage.initStyle(StageStyle.TRANSPARENT);
----

Do note that this line of code has to be placed in the `start()` method of `MainApp.java` instead of `MainWindow.java` or `UiManager.java` so as to specify the removal of window decorations immediately upon the launch of the application. Otherwise, there will be an `exception` thrown: `Cannot set style once stage has been set visible`.

This immediately removes the window's title bar. However, this also removes the default window functionalities such as being able to resize the window, move the window's position, minimise, maximise and exit the application proper.

Hence, the second step is to rebuild these functionalities. The design considered was to bake these functionalities along with the minimise, maximise and exit button into the existing menu bar. The three aforementioned buttons are added in Scene Builder, using the same height as the menu bar so that it would look coherent.

Now that we have added the buttons, we can make use of the buttons' event handlers to trigger the window functionalities.

Moving of window is implemented by setting the menu bar to listen on the events such as `onMousePressed` and `onMouseDragged`:

----
private void enableMovableWindow() {
    menuBar.setOnMousePressed((event) -> {
        xOffset = event.getSceneX();
        yOffset = event.getSceneY();
    });

    menuBar.setOnMouseDragged((event) -> {
        primaryStage.setX(event.getScreenX() - xOffset);
        primaryStage.setY(event.getScreenY() - yOffset);
    });
}
----

Similarly, minimising of window is implemented by setting the minimise button to listen on `onMouseClicked` event and uses the following method that was found from the JavaFX Stage API.

----
primaryStage.setIconified(true)
----

Maximising of window is also implemented in the same way.

----
maximiseButton.setOnMouseClicked((event) -> {
    primaryStage.setMaximized(true);
    maximiseButton.setId("restoreButton");
});
----

However, the default behavior of maximising a window is made in a way such that the first time the maximise button is clicked, the window maximises fully (the code above works), but when the second time the button is clicked, it should restore the previous unmaximised state and window size. Hence, we have to utilise `onMousePressed` this time.

----
maximiseButton.setOnMousePressed((event) -> {
    primaryStage.setMaximized(false);
    maximiseButton.setId("maximiseButton");
});
----

Exiting the window could make use of the existing `handleExit` method in `MainWindow.java`, hence we just have to set the event handler for exit button in `MainWindow.fxml` itself.

----
<Button fx:id="closeButton" mnemonicParsing="false" prefHeight="45" prefWidth="60" onAction="#handleExit" />
----

The last functionality we have to rebuild is resizing of the window. We make use of a helper class called `UiResize` whose methods were adapted from StackOverflow. It is important to note that the `minWidth` and `minHeight` parameters for `enableResizableWindow` window should be the same as the `MIN_WIDTH` and `MIN_HEIGHT` specified in `MainWindow.java` so that the resizing mechanism does not exceed the allowable minimum widths and heights of the window i.e. we disallow window resizing to the point that there is no more pixels to resize which would otherwise become a bug itself.

==== Rounding Borders

The second step was to create rounded borders for the application. Since the entire window is encapsulated within a JavaFX `VBox` container, we can simply style it using its `fx:id` called `rootVBox` in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) as follows.

----
#rootVBox {
    -fx-border-radius: 10;
    -fx-background-radius: 10;
}
----

==== Resizing Components

The third step was to resize each component to give priority to each of them, especially enlarging the space of contacts list to make it stand out since it is the one of the most important aspects of our application.

----
<padding>
    <Insets bottom="10" left="20" right="20" top="0" />
</padding>
----

==== Using Custom Fonts

The fourth step is to ensure the consistency of fonts displayed across different platforms e.g. Windows, macOS and to allow usage of custom fonts e.g. `Open Sans`.

All custom fonts are stored in `/resources/fonts` directory and a singleton class `UiFont` is used to embed and load all the fonts into the application at runtime.

The following method in the `UiFont` class has to be called in the `start()` method of `UiManager` class as during that instance, most of the other UI components have not been created.

----
public void embedFonts() {
    for (String font : fontList) {
        Font.loadFont(getClass().getResourceAsStream(FONTS_FILE_FOLDER + font), 10);
    }
}
----

==== Enhancing Color Scheme

The last step to enhancing the user interface would be to use subtle colors that would highlight visual controls that users would often interact with such as command box and contacts list. The key is also to use as little colors as possible for the majority background space so as to create a minimalistic interface as well.

The main colors used are full white for the background (`#ffffff`) and a slightly gray tone for command box and contacts list (`#f4f4f4`). This light color scheme is used for the "Day" theme.

Since we allow the user to switch between two themes, we would have to create two CSS with different color schemes.

The main colors used for the "Night" theme dark-greenish black (`#272822`) and a slightly brighter gray tone that matches the aforementioned black (`#4a4b40`).

To maintain consistency between two themes, static (non-changing) components such as the menu bar, footer, scroll bar, favorite icons maintain the same red (`#d13438`) and black (`#2c2c2c`) color combination.

Finally, to increase the overall contrast and to provide an easier way to identify contacts via tags, tag labels are brightly colored. A random color generator is implemented to give each tag a different color. To ensure even distribution of colors are generated, we also make use of the golden ratio conjugate `0.618033988749895`.

----
private String generateRandomColor() {
    float randomHue = random.nextFloat();
    randomHue += GOLDEN_RATIO;
    randomHue = randomHue % 1;

    Color result = Color.getHSBColor(randomHue, 0.5f, 0.85f);
    return String.format("#%02x%02x%02x", result.getRed(), result.getGreen(), result.getBlue());
}
----

==== Setting Focus on Command Box

To allow user to begin typing immediately upon application launch, we have to set the focus to the command box text field as such.

----
Platform.runLater(() -> commandTextField.requestFocus());
----

// end::enhance-ui[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Theming Mechanism

The theme mechanism is facilitated by a singleton class `UiTheme` which will be called inside the `MainWindow` constructor where it passes its `scene` into the `UiTheme` class.

The `scene` is necessary for changing the CSS at runtime e.g.:

----
scene.getStylesheets().setAll("PATH_TO_CSS_FILE");
----

When a user executes the `theme` command to change the theme, `ThemeCommand` class will pass the option `String` specified by the user into the following method in `UiTheme` class.

----
public void changeTheme(String option) {
    scene.getStylesheets().clear();

    if (option.equals(PREFIX_OPTION + ThemeCommand.COMMAND_OPTION_DAY)) {
        scene.getStylesheets().setAll(THEME_DAY, THEME_DAY_EXTENSIONS);
        browserPanel.loadDefaultPage(scene);
    } else {
        scene.getStylesheets().setAll(THEME_NIGHT, THEME_NIGHT_EXTENSIONS);
        browserPanel.loadDefaultPage(scene);
    }
}
----

.Sequence Diagram for Changing Theme
image::changing-theme-sequence-diagram.png[width="600"]

To ensure that the user does not have to change their preferred theme every time the application starts, we will save their choice as a user preference. The user preference is stored as a variable of class `ThemeSettings` inside `UserPrefs` class. Essentially, we will store the CSS file path e.g. `view/ThemeDay.css` in `preferences.json`.

Finally, when the application starts, user's theme preference will be read in the `MainWindow` class.

----
private void setDefaultTheme(UserPrefs prefs, Scene scene) {
    scene.getStylesheets().addAll(prefs.getThemeSettings().getTheme(),
            prefs.getThemeSettings().getThemeExtensions());
}
----

.Sequence Diagram for Saving Theme as User Preference
image::saving-theme-preference-seq-diagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Ways to change the application theme +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use of singleton class `UiTheme` to change the theme +
**Pros:** Declutters the `MainWindow` class and provide a dedicated class that manages all the changing of themes. This ensures scalability since `UiTheme` can contain a lot more CSS file paths to more themes for future add-ons. It also dedicates storing of CSS file paths in public `String` which can be called by other many classes. Last but not least, it is easier for `ThemeCommand` class to call its instance and use the `changeTheme` method directly. +
**Cons:** Causes tighter coupling, and violates the single responsibility principle since `UiTheme` controls its own creation and lifecycle +
**Alternative 2:** Change the themes in `MainWindow` class directly +
**Pros:** Decreases coupling +
**Cons:** Clutters the `MainWindow` class and makes it harder for `ThemeCommand` class to access the methods from `MainWindow`.
// end::theme[]

// tag::display-photo[]
=== Display Photo Mechanism

To allow user to find their contacts more easily, we implemented the adding of display photo feature. This would be especially helpful to those users who are visual learners so that they can remember their contacts more easily as well.

.DisplayPhoto is one of the members in the Person class
image::person-class-diagram-displayphoto.png[width="800"]

==== Contacts without Display Photo

We took into consideration that there ought to be some contacts that would not have any display photo, hence instead of display a static default display photo, we decided to make it more intuitive since our goal is to enhance the our user's collective memory of their contacts.

For these contacts, they will have a colored display photo thumbnail with their initials in it.

All display photos will be rounded by setting a circle-shaped clip to the `displayPhotoImageView`.

----
double value = displayPhotoImageView.getFitWidth() / 2;
Circle clip = new Circle(value, value, value);
displayPhotoImageView.setClip(clip);
----

After which, we will color the rounded thumbnails with random pastel colors. We use yet another random color generator (another was used for coloring tag labels as previously mentioned) as opposed to having one is because we decided that the display photo should use a lighter color so as not to steal the attention away from the main contact details. Pastel colors in this case blends in well with the UI.

----
private String generateRandomPastelColor() {
    int red = random.nextInt(256);
    int green = random.nextInt(256);
    int blue = random.nextInt(256);

    Color mixer = new Color(235, 235, 235);
    red = (red + mixer.getRed()) / 2;
    green = (green + mixer.getGreen()) / 2;
    blue = (blue + mixer.getBlue()) / 2;

    Color result = new Color(red, green, blue);
    return String.format("#%02x%02x%02x", result.getRed(), result.getGreen(), result.getBlue());
}
----

We will color the rounded thumbnail by using `setFill`.

----
Circle backgroundCircle = new Circle(value);
backgroundCircle.setFill(Paint.valueOf(getColorForPerson(nameOfPerson)));
----

Lastly, to add the contact's initials into the rounded thumbnail, we have to extract their name and use regular expression i.e. `?<=\\w)\\w+(?=\\s)\\s+` to derive only their initials.
We also limit the number of initials to two.

----
private String extractInitials (String name) {
    int noOfInitials = 1;
    if (name.split("\\s+").length > 1) {
        noOfInitials = 2;
    }
    return name.replaceAll("(?<=\\w)\\w+(?=\\s)\\s+", "").substring(0, noOfInitials);
}
----

The text for contact's initials is added programmatically.

----
Text personInitialsText = new Text(extractInitials(nameOfPerson));
personInitialsText.setFill(Paint.valueOf("white"));
----

It is to be noted that instead of adding the coloring and text to display photo's `Image View`, we add it directly into its parent i.e. `Stack Pane`.

----
displayPhotoStackPane.getChildren().addAll(backgroundCircle, personInitialsText);
----

==== Contacts with Display Photo

For contacts whom users have added a display photo, the mechanism is pretty straight forward in that we simply point the display photo's `Image View` to the path user has specified to import the dislay photo from.

----
displayPhotoImageView.setImage(new Image(person.getDisplayPhoto().getAbsoluteFilePath()));
----

There are a few restrictions to the display photo we have set. The display photo specified by the user has to be:

* Of a legitimate file path
* Within 1MB of size
* Of type `jpg` or `jpeg` or `png` only

Failing which, the display photo will not be added. The above restrictions are checked by the `isValidPhoto` method in `DisplayPhoto` class itself.

----
private static boolean isValidPhoto(String test) {
    File file = new File(test);
    return file.exists()
            && file.length() <= MAX_SIZE
            && (test.endsWith(ALLOWED_TYPE_JPG)
            || test.endsWith(ALLOWED_TYPE_JPEG)
            || test.endsWith(ALLOWED_TYPE_PNG));
}
----

If the display photo specified by the user is valid, we will go ahead to:

1. Update the `DisplayPhoto` field of the contact,
2. Copy the photo into the application's `data` directory,
3. Set the display photo `Image View` to the file path of the photo in our `data` directory

Before copying the photo to the application's `data` directory, it is important to note that in the instance when the user just launched KayPoh for the first time, and tries to add a display photo to a contact, there will be an `IOException` thrown. This is because `data` directory is not yet created; it will only be created when a user executes a command that will trigger `AddressBookChanged` event. Although changing of `DisplayPhoto` through add or edit commands can trigger the event, the copying of file in `DisplayPhoto` class precedes the event.

Hence, we have to check whether `data` directory exists first. We can simply use `createDirectories` from `java.nio.Files`. This method kills two birds with one stone since it will not re-create the directory and neither will it throw an `exception` even if the directory already exists.

----
Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(DEFAULT_SAVE_DIR));
----

Then, we copy the display photo file into the `data` directory using `Files.copy` also from the same package `java.nio.Files`.

----
// REPLACAE_EXITING: If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it is not a non-empty directory.
Files.copy(from, to, REPLACE_EXISTING);
----

Finally, the last thing to note would be that for JavaFX's `ImageView` to load an image, it has to be set with a file path that contains `file://` at the beginning of a file path.

----
"file://" + Paths.get(value).toAbsolutePath().toUri().getPath();
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Copying of display photo image file into application's `data` directory +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using `Files.copy` from Java's NIO package +
**Pros:** Does not require adding of third party libraries +
**Cons:** Has to add an additional check for the existence of the `data` directory first before copying to prevent an `exception` +
**Alternative 2:** Using `FileUtils.copyFileToDirectory` from a third party library - Apache Commons IO +
**Pros:** One-liner implementation that checks for both file and directory's existence +
**Cons:** Require importing of third party libraries into Gradle

// end::display-photo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE`: Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
