== Overview

Bluebird is a Java-based address book and task organisation software application. With concise and clear
descriptions, our developer guide aims to provide an inside look as to how the Bluebird team created the software, should
any fellow developers be interested to contribute to our application. In addition, with diagrams to illustrate
the architectural flow of how components interact with one another and beginner-friendly explanations, our developer
guide aims to also serve as an avenue for beginners to software application building.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

==== Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
Model View Components

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

=== Software Design Principles
Intro

==== Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

==== Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

 Open-Closed Principle (OCP): A module should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 That is, modules should be written so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified.


When different classes interact with one another, coupling is inevitable and and interaction will naturally lead to increased coupling. Bluebird applies OCP in order to reduce coupling and increase cohesion. +
As shown in Figure 2.7.2.1, if a new command is added to Bluebird, there is no need to modify the `Command` class, the new command can simply just inherit from
`Command`.

image::OCPLogic.png[width="800"]


==== Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

Bluebird applies the Liskov Substitution Principle to avoid breaking the functionality of the code.
An example of this can be seen below:

image::LSP-CommandClass.png[width="500"]

The `UndoableCommand` class follows the Liskov Substitution Principle because it fulfills `Command` 's
expectation of `UndoableCommand` objects. Substituting `DeleteCommand` 's objects for `UndoableCommand` 's objects
will not break the `Command` class functionality.


==== Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting of contacts

The sort command sorts the `People` in `AddressBook` based on their `Name`, `Phone`, `Email` or `Address`. The sort command is also an `UndoableCommand` and users can undo the sort if they wish to.
`SortCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand` which inherits from `Command` and the logic is
shown in Figure 4.4.1 below.

image::sortLogicDiagram.png[width="700"]
Figure 4.4.1: Logic of SortCommand

There will be a `SortCommandParser` as well to parse out the `KEYWORD` which is either name, phone, email
or address. This will ensure that users type in the right `KEYWORD` to sort the list however they want.

==== Sorting by name

Suppose a user wants to sort by name, the user will type `sort name` into the command box. This will then be processed by `LogicManager` which executes the command and `AddressBookParser` will
parse the command accordingly. A `SortCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager` which will then execute it. Finally, the result of the execution will be returned and displayed
on the `ResultDisplay` Ui for the user. The sequence diagram for this scenario is shown in Figure 4.4.2 below.

image::sortSD.png[width="800"]
Figure 4.4.2: Sequence diagram for sorting by name

When `SortCommand` executes,

. It will first call the sortList() method in `ModelManager`
. Then, it will call the sortList() method in `AddressBook`
. Finally, it will call the sort() method to sort the internal list in `UniquePersonList`

The code snippet below shows how `SortCommand` calls the different methods.

[source,java]
----
public class SortCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    ...
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        model.sortList(toSort);
        ...
    }
    ...
}

public class ModelManager extends ComponentManager implements Model {
    ...
    @Override
    public void sortList(String toSort) {
        addressBook.sortList(toSort);
        ...
    }
    ...
}

public class AddressBook implements ReadOnlyAddressBook {
    ...
    public void sortList(String toSort) {
        persons.sort(toSort);
    }
    ...
}
----

The sequence diagram for executeUndoableCommand() is given in Figure 4.4.3 below.

image::sortExecuteSD.png[width="750"]
Figure 4.4.3: Sequence diagram for SortCommand executeUndoableCommand()


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Which details to sort +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** List of contacts will be able to be sorted by name, phone, email or address +
**Pros:** This gives users freedom to select how they want it to be sorted by +
**Cons:** Some users may not find the need to sort by phone, email or address +
**Alternative 2:** List of contacts will be sorted by name only +
**Pros:** Majority of users will only sort by name when they want to view their list of contacts +
**Cons:** For the minority that may want to sort using other details, they do not have the option to do so +

**Aspect:** To sort automatically by name every time Bluebird starts or not +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** List of contacts will be sorted by name automatically everytime Bluebird starts +
**Pros:** Users do not have to sort every single time they add a new contact +
**Cons:** Some users may only want to sort by other details other than name, therefore they have to sort every time they run Bluebird +
**Alternative 2:** Not automatically sort +
**Pros:** This gives users freedom to select how they want their list to be sorted +
**Cons:** Forgetful users may not be able to find their contact if they forget to sort by name when they add a new contact +
// end::sort[]

//  tag::find[]
=== Enhanced find

The old find feature is only capable of finding the target `Person` using his/her name. Furthermore,
the user has to type out the full name in order to be able to find the `Person`. +

The enhanced find feature allows users to find the `Person` you want using their name, phone, email, address or tag. Keywords need not be typed in full and partial keywords will still be able to find the `Person`
(e.g find jos will return Josephine).

This is implemented by further refining the `PersonHasKeywordsPredicate` that was originally used.
`PersonHasKeywordsPredicate` is used to compare the `Person` 's details with the keyword provided. If
there is a match, the `Person` will be shown on Bluebird as found.
The code snippet below shows how the refinement was made.

[source,java]
----
public class PersonHasKeywordsPredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {
    ...
    private boolean isPersonMatch(ReadOnlyPerson person, String[] nameParts, ArrayList<String> tagParts) {
        for (String tag : tagParts) {
            if (keywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> tag.startsWith(keyword.toLowerCase()))) {
                return !isFindPinned || person.isPinned();
            }
        }
        for (String name : nameParts) {
            if (keywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> name.toLowerCase().startsWith(keyword.toLowerCase()))) {
                return !isFindPinned || person.isPinned();
            }
        }
        if (keywords.size() != 0 && person.getAddress().toString().toLowerCase().contains(fullWord)) {
            return !isFindPinned || person.isPinned();
        }
        if (keywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> person.getEmail().toString().toLowerCase()
                .startsWith(keyword.toLowerCase()))) {
            return !isFindPinned || person.isPinned();
        }
        return keywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> person.getPhone()
                .toString().startsWith(keyword.toLowerCase())) && (!isFindPinned || person.isPinned());
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Defining how accurate the find command will be +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The person will be found if their names, phone, email or tags start with the
 keywords typed by the user. The address on the other hand can be found if any part of it contains
 the keyword. In addition, partial keywords will be able to match the person. +
**Pros:** If the person's name, phone, email or tags can be found as long as it contains any of the keywords,
the user may end up with a list full of person they did not want (e.g find br will return Brandon and also Abraham). Hence,
it is better to find a person if their names start with keywords.
For the address, users generally tend to type only the street name, hence it is better to find address as long as it contains
any of the keywords. +
**Cons:** By finding using partial keywords, users may also end up with a list of people they did not want. +
**Alternative 2:** The person will be found only if the user type out the details of the person they want in full (e.g
find Josephine, or find Blk 231, Sembawang Close 221 #02-232, S750231). +
**Pros:** It is the most accurate way to find the exact person the user wants. +
**Cons:** The user may forget certain details of the person and be unable to find him.
//  end::find[]

//  tag::alias[]
=== Alias / Unalias

The alias and unalias features are implemented by comparing creating a new AliasToken model which contains all created aliases,
this model is checked against user input in the parser and converts any alias keywords to their representations before other
commands are parsed. Each AliasToken consists of a keyword (the main alias) and representation (what it means) and they can
be used for both commands or shortcuts. For example : alias k/disappear s/hide , this makes the hide command
to work with AliasToken keyword disappear. Unaliasing the AliasToken keyword token simply removes the AliasToken.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Defining how accurate the alias command will be +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Aliases are parsed based on their keywords which are stored in a UniqueAliasTokenList.
 All user input will parse for aliases first before dispatching to command parser, including parsing of both the command
 word as well as the command arguments. +
**Pros:** If the alias keyword is valid, it can be used as both a command alias and a shortcut alias. The user has the choice
to choose any word to alias if they desire to do so. +
**Cons:** It may take longer to parse user input. +
**Alternative 2:** The alias is only checked for commands words in the parser, without the implementation of a
 model. +
**Pros:** The parsing of user input is more straightforward and quicker. +
**Cons:** The user is very restricted on what to alias and cannot have aliases for shortcut words.
//  end::alias[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Enhanced Delete

The enhanced delete feature allows for multiple indices to be accepted by the parser. This is done by splitting the inputs into multiple string tokens,
each containing the index of the person to be deleted. A list is then used to store all the indices of the personsToDelete.
This enhancement is then achieved by iterating through the list and deleting the desired persons using the ModelManager.
The enhanced delete also allows for the user to input a range of indices of persons to be deleted.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Defining how accurate the delete command will be +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Indices are parsed into a list containing all the index of persons to be deleted. +
A loop is then used to iterate through the list to delete the persons requested by the user. +
**Pros:** If the index is valid (within range), the user can delete as many persons as they choose. +
**Cons:** The use of a loop will increase the time for the code to run. +
**Alternative 2:** The indices are deleted one by one, without using a list. +
**Pros:** If the index is valid (within range), the user can delete as many persons as they choose. +
**Cons:** It has to display the result repeatedly after every every person is deleted successfully. +
// end::delete[]

// tag::hideunhide[]
=== Hide / Unhide

The hide feature allows for multiple indices to be accepted by the parser. This is done similar to the enhanced delete
feature, where inputs are split into multiple string tokens, each containing the index of the person to be hidden. The
`Person` class has a boolean variable called `isPrivate` that is set to false by default. Only when the `hide` command
is executed will the variable change to true, and conceal the person contact from the main list of contacts.
A list, listhidden, is then used to store all the indices of the person(s) to be hidden. Unhide is then done to revert
the previously hidden indices from the list storing all hidden persons by reverting the `isPrivate` boolean variable to
false.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Defining how accurate the hide command will be +
** Alternative 1 (current choice):** Indices are parsed into a list containing all the index of person to be deleted. +
**Pros:** If the index is valid (within range), the user can hide as many persons as they choose. +
**Cons:** The use of a loop will increase the time for the code to run. +
**Alternative 2**: The indices are hidden one by one, without using a list. +
**Pros:** If the index is valid (within range), the user can hide as many persons as they choose. +
**Cons:** User has to repeatedly type the command multiple times, and application has to display the result repeatedly
after every person is hidden successfully.
// end::hideunhide[]

// tag::pinunpin[]
=== Pin / Unpin
The pin and unpin command allows the user to pin and unpin important `Person` for easy access. The `Person` class has
a boolean variable called `isPinned` that is set to `false` by default. Only when the `pin` command is executed will the
variable change to `true`. Similarly, the variable can be changed from `true` to `false` when `unpin` command is executed.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: How pinned person will be displayed on the UI +
** Alternative 1 (current choice):** A pinned person will have a star symbol next to their name if they are pinned +
**Pros:** It is easy to see and the Ui is clean +
**Cons:** It is harder to implement as a new `ObjectProperty` has to be added to the `PersonCard` to update the UI of it +
**Alternative 2**: The pinned person will just have a `Tag` that says `pinned` +
**Pros:** It is easier to implement because `Tag` has already been implemented. A new `Tag` called `pinned` can just be added to the `Person` +
**Cons:** It may not be noticeable if the person already has many `Tag` on them.
// end::pinunpin[]

// tag::tutorial[]
=== First time tutorial
The first time tutorial will be launched when users start the Bluebird app for the very first time. To
detect that Bluebird is launched for the first time, a boolean variable `isFirstTimeOpen` in `MainApp` is used.
It is set to `false` by default and will only be set to `true` when Bluebird detects that `addressbook.xml` is not found.
The code snippet below shows how `isFirstTimeOpen` is set to true.

[source,java]
----
public class MainApp extends Application {
    ...
    private Model initModelManager(Storage storage, UserPrefs userPrefs) {
        ...
        try {
            addressBookOptional = storage.readAddressBook();
            if (!addressBookOptional.isPresent()) {
                logger.info("Data file not found. Will be starting with a sample AddressBook");
                isFirstTimeOpen = true;
            }
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
----


When `isFirstTimeOpen` is detected as `true` by the `MainWindow`, `TutorialPanel` will be added into the tutorial place holder.
 `TutorialPanel` will be removed at the end of the tutorial.
The code snippet below shows how `TutorialPanel` is added in the
`MainWindow` when Bluebird is launched for the first time.

[source,java]
----
public class MainWindow extends UiPart<Region> {
    ...
    void fillInnerParts() {
        ...
        if (MainApp.isFirstTimeOpen()) {
            TutorialPanel tutorialPanel = new TutorialPanel(this, tutorialPlaceholder);
            tutorialPlaceholder.getChildren().add(tutorialPanel.getRoot());
        }
        ...
}
----

Figure 4.10.1 shows the sequence of events that happens.

image::FinalTutSD.png[width="800"]
Figure 4.10.1: Sequence diagram for first time tutorial

In the reference frame "carry out tutorial", the tutorial will be looped until the end of tutorial. Users can choose
to click next, back or skip tutorial at any point of the tutorial. The sequence of events that happens in
"carry out tutorial" is shown in figure 4.10.2 below.

image::sdCarryOutTut.png[width="800"]
Figure 4.10.2: Sequence diagram for refrence frame "carry out tutorial"

The code snippet below shows how `TutorialPanel` is removed after
the end of tutorial.

[source,java]
----
public class TutorialPanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    ...
    private void endTutorial() {
        mainWindow.unhighlightAll();
        tutorialPlaceholder.getChildren().remove(this.getRoot());
    }
    ...
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: What to include in the tutorial +
** Alternative 1 (current choice):** Introduce the different UI panels in Bluebird and to give a brief
 overview of the features Bluebird has. Allow user to explore and try out the different commands by themselves +
**Pros:** Users will decide which feature to try out by themselves and learn how Bluebird works +
**Cons:** By being brief and letting users try it out for themselves, users will not know the expected outcome of
 different commands +
**Alternative 2**: By spoon-feeding users and introduce each features one by one +
**Pros:** This is the most comprehensive way to teach users of all the features Bluebird has to offer +
**Cons:** The tutorial will be lengthy and users may just skip it without learning of different features
// end::tutorial[]

// tag::add[]
=== Enhanced Add
The enhanced add feature no longer requires the user to fill in every field as it now only requires the `n/NAME` field
to be filled. This feature is done by using a constructor to initialize the default field as empty. This is implemented
using an additional parameter in the ParserUtil class to determine whether the default constructor for an empty field
should be called.

image::addSD.png[width="800"]

An extract of the code from ParserUtil class shows how this is being implemented. The command parameter determines
whether or not a field is required in the parser. If the parser is called from the add command, it will call a
default constructor where the parsed field is empty. +

[source, java]
----
public static Optional<Name> parseName(Optional<String> name, String command) throws IllegalValueException {
        requireNonNull(name);
        if (command.equals("add")) {
            return name.isPresent() ? Optional.of(new Name(name.get())) : Optional.of(new Name(0));
        } else {
            return name.isPresent() ? Optional.of(new Name(name.get())) : Optional.empty();
        }
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementing an option to accept and create the empty fields +
** Alternative 1 (current choice):** By using a command parameter in the ParserUtil class +
**Pros:** This will allow flexibility in implementing, or calling the necessary constructors in the respective person
  field classes +
**Cons:** There will be a need for overloading of constructors in the classes for the person fields +
**Alternative 2**: By having a new class to initialise empty fields for person added, similar to the EditPersonDescriptor
 class in the Edit command +
**Pros:** This is the most comprehensive way to initialise fields without the need of new constructors in the classes for
 the respective fields +
**Cons:** The code will be unnecessarily lengthy and may cause features to break +
// end::add[]

// tag::parentmode[]
=== Parent Mode
When Bluebird is launched, the boolean variable `isParentEnabled` in `AddressBookParser` is set to `false`
by default. This means that Parent Mode will be off by default and the number of commands
available will be limited. The `ParentModeCommand` will enable all commands for the parent to use by setting
`isParentEnabled` to `true`.

The code snippet below shows how `AddressBookParser` prevents certain commands such as `DeleteCommand` from
executing when `isParentEnabled` is `false`. A `ParseException` will be thrown which will display
"Unknown Command" to the user. If `isParentEnabled` is `true` the `DeleteCommand` will be accepted and
executed accordingly.

[source, java]
----
public class AddressBookParser {
    ...
    public AddressBookParser() {
        ...
        this.isParentEnabled = false;
    }
    ...
    public Command parseCommand(String userInput) throws ParseException {
    ...
        case DeleteCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
            if (!isParentEnabled) {
                throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_UNKNOWN_CHILD_COMMAND);
            }
            ...
            if (isPersonEnabled && !isTaskEnabled) {
                return new DeleteCommandParser().parse(checkedArguments);
            } else {
                return new DeleteTaskCommandParser().parse(checkedArguments);
            }
    ...
    }

}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Which commands will be unavailable for the child to use +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: All commands that modifies Bluebird's contact list or task list will be unavailable +
**Pros**: This provides maximum safety for the parents +
**Cons**: If the child adds contacts or tasks wrongly, he has to add a new command and will not be able to
delete or edit the previous one +
**Alternative 2**: Only prevent commands that deletes Bluebird's contact list or task list +
**Pros**: This allows child to edit the contacts or tasks if they were to add wrongly +
**Cons**: There is a possibility that the child may edit important contacts or tasks.
// end::parentmode[]

// tag::birthdayfield[]
=== Birthday Field
The Birthday field is an additional attribute to the person class for contacts in Bluebird. Since the addition of
feature 4.11 Enhanced Add, not all fields are compulsory, except for the name field. Therefore the birthday field can be
added individually in addition to the name field when adding a new contact. Alternatively, an existing person's contact
card in Bluebird can be edited to add the birth date. There are 2 valid formats for adding birth dates to the birthday
field, which are `DD/MM/YYYY` or `DD/MM/YY`, where only digits are permitted. Months in the form of alphabets are not
permitted.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Format of birth date input +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Input all commands only the format of `DD/MM/YYYY` and `DD/MM/YY`. +
**Pros**: This provides standardization of date format where the day comes before the month. +
**Cons**: Not yet able to accommodate date input in short formed words, such as Nov or Dec. +
**Alternative 2**: Allows command format to be in alphabets as well in addition to formats in alternative 1. +
**Pros**: More user friendly as user can enter months in short formed words as well. +
**Cons**: Tougher to implement as will have to account every permutation of dates entered.

The implementation of the method is credited to Hyma Tiyyagura.
// end::birthdayfield[]

// tag::showbirthdays[]
=== Show Birthdays
The `showbirthdays` command scans through the list of person contacts in Bluebird and displays the person(s) whose
birthdays fall on the same date as the current day with respect to the user. The `showbirthdays` command is made possible
with the `CheckBirthdays` class. The CheckBirthdays class determines if a contact's birthday falls on the current day
by checking if the day and month of the contact's birthday is equal to the current day and month date.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Whether `showbirthdays` should show birthdays for the day today, or for the week or month.
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `showbirthdays` command only shows for today's birthdays.
**Pros**: Shows the most relevant and soonest dates.
**Cons**: User might want to know the upcoming birthdays as well.
**Alternative 2**: `showbirthdays` command allows the user to set the time duration of birthdays he would like to view.
**Pros**: Shows the upcoming birthdays so that user can pre-empt.
**Cons**: Might vary by days, weeks, month, and will be much tougher to implement.

The implementation of the method is credited to Hyma Tiyyagura.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
