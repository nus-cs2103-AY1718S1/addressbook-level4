By: `Team F11-B2`      Since: `Aug 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

// tag::styling[]
=== Styling and Themes

image::StyleSheetColorNames.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.2 : Important variable names of the Stylesheet_

The Stylesheets loaded are mainly controlled with the following global stylesheet variables

```
* {
    -fx-base-background-color-0: #181b1d;
    -fx-base-background-color-1: #2e3138;
    -fx-base-text-fill-color: white;
    -fx-base-text-fill-color-alt: black;
    -fx-base-text-fill-color-labels: white;
    -fx-label-text-fill-color: #010505;
    -fx-list-cell-even: #3c3e3f;
    -fx-list-cell-odd: #4a4f58;
    -fx-list-cell-selected: #36435f;
    -fx-list-cell-selected-border: #3e7b91;
    -fx-list-cell-empty: #383838;
}
```

Any new components added to the themes or stylesheets should utilise these base colors or variables to ensure the ease of creation and importation into other themes.

// end::styling[]

// tag::defaultPage[]
=== Default.html

image::defaultPage.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Default Landing page of the SocialBook App_

The first page that the User sees is the landing page of the application. This landing page resides in the `default.html` file and the corresponding default theme along with it `DarkTheme.css`.

This landing page is to present the first time users with some form of feedback when they are first introduced to the application.

Additional Ui help such as arrows and pointers that can be implemented in the HTML with simple CSS stylings will be coming in `V2.0`.

// end::defaultPage[]

// tag::userInterface[]
=== DetailedPersonCard and PersonCard

_Figure 2.5.1 : Majority of contact information is to be shown in the DetailedPersonCard_

image::personCard.png[width="400"]
_Figure 2.5.2 : Condensed information to be shown in PersonCard_

The main design principles used here is to focus on the Social Aspect of the User's contacts.

In order to do so, the main bulk of the real estate given to the User has to be the Browser.

// end::userInterface[]

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

// tag::model[]

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores the UserPerson object that represents the user's own contact card.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// end::model[]

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.
* can save `UserPerson` objects in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::websiteselectionevent[]
=== Web command for Social Links

The web selection commmand mechanism is executed with the use of a `WebsiteSelectionRequestEvent`, which resides inside `commons.events.ui`. This allows for the event to be handled by the UI component required.

image::WebsiteSelectionEvent.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, the link between the `Logic` and the `Ui` exists in the `EventsCenter`. Other commands that utilise this mechanism includes `Select`.

This mechanism allows for the addition of other Ui components, such as buttons or tabs to replace the trigger event.

[NOTE]
If web command is executed before the selection of a `PersonCard`, the event trigger would simply load a default page.



==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of URL loadings +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement URL loadings within the `BrowserPanel` +
**Pros:** We will not have a separation of classes, or the need to update any data values within any dynamically generated objects. `BrowserPanel` handles all URLs, URL parsings, and had the necessary information to process or execute these commands. +
**Cons:** `BrowserPanel` has to be pre-loaded with website URLs, if not the `Websites` within the `Person` class has to be a full URL +
// end::websiteselectionevent[]


// tag::websitebuttonbar[]
=== Button Bar for Social Links

The button bar implemented within the UI is operated by the use of an event trigger `ButtonSelectionPressedEvent`, which resides inside the commons classes. The actual implementation of the web page loading is done within the `BrowserPanel` class.

The buttons residing within the button bar raises `ButtonSelectionPressedEvent` that parses its own button FX.id to the `BrowserPanel`, which then triggers the internal functions that calls the URL to be loaded.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `WebsiteButtonBar` resides within the `MainWindow`, despite not having any interactions with the BrowserPanel directly.


Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `BrowserPanel` will not be loaded.

Once the User selects a person from the `PersonListPanel`, which is a `PersonCard`, the `SelectedPerson` is updated through the use of an event trigger. The `BrowserPanel` then stores this `SelectedPerson` until it is updated through listening for the event trigger.

Residing in BrowserPanel, the available social WebLinks are loaded and dynamically created. Supposed a person does not have any social links, only a simple google search and address search button will be displayed as a result.

The User then clicks on a button within the `WebsiteButtonBar`. The buttons that exist within the `ButtonBar` is dynamically created through the list of websites that exists within the `Person` object `coming in v1.3`.


[NOTE]
If a button is pressed before the selection of a `PersonCard`, the event trigger would simply load a default page.



==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of URL loadings +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement URL loadings within the `BrowserPanel` via event handlers +
**Pros:** We will not have a seperation of classes, or the need to update any data values within any dynamically generated objects. `BrowserPanel` handles all URLs, URL parsings, and had the necessary information to process or execute these commands. +
**Alternative 2:** Create different `BrowserPanel` s for each new Website +
**Pros:** Swaps each Panel using tabs and allows for various design elements to be made for each URL loaded +
**Cons:** Increases the number of `Tabs` to be created with each person website, and increases the complexities at the UI level.
// end::websitebuttonbar[]

// tag::SortCommand[]
=== Sort Command
The `SortCommand` modifies the listing in the AddressBook data. It will permanently sort the list of contacts
by the `filterType` indicated, which has to be one of the following: Name, Email, Phone, Address or Default. The default sorting will sort the list by name.
+ The command parameters are 'sort FILTERTYPE'. Simply entering 'sort' will set FILTERTYPE to default. Aliases are available
for each of the sorting methods for convenience. The aliases are simply the first letter in each filter.

The Sort Command will first remember the current filteredList's predicate, call the method sortFilteredList in the model's `AddressBook`,
modify the `PersonList` via the sort method in `UniquePersonList`, then indicate that the AddressBook has been changed,
which then calls a method that saves the data locally. The old predicate is reapplied to the new filteredList. Thus, the list is permanently modified and overwritten.
The original list is lost permanently, unless it is one of the other sorted lists, whereby the Sort Command
can be used to obtain the required list again by passing in the relevant filter as a parameter.

The sort method implementation is displayed below. A switch case excerpt is used to determine the type of comparison that the
anonymously declared comparator will use to order 2 persons. If more types of filters are desired, they simply have
to be added to the list of cases below. Default currenlty sorts by name as there is no way to sort by the original
listing, which is date added.
----
    public void sortPersons(String filterType) {

        Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> personComparator = (ReadOnlyPerson person1,
                                                   ReadOnlyPerson person2) -> {

            String arg1;
            String arg2;
            switch (filterType) {
            case ARG_NAME:
                arg1 = person1.getName().toString().toLowerCase();
                arg2 = person2.getName().toString().toLowerCase();
                break;
            case ARG_PHONE:
                arg1 = person1.getPhone().toString();
                arg2 = person2.getPhone().toString();
                break;
            case ARG_EMAIL:
                arg1 = person1.getEmail().toString();
                arg2 = person2.getEmail().toString();
                break;
            case ARG_ADDRESS:
                arg1 = person1.getAddress().toString();
                arg2 = person2.getAddress().toString();
                break;
            default:
                arg1 = person1.getName().toString();
                arg2 = person2.getName().toString();
                break;
            }
            return arg1.compareTo(arg2);
        };

        FXCollections.sort(internalList, personComparator);
    }
----

Sorting by name will display the list with names in ascending alphabetical order, regardless of capitalisation. +
Sorting by phone will display the list with phone numbers in ascending order. +
Sorting by email will display the list with emails in ascending alphabetical order, with priority given to the first
email entered for a person. This means that the primary email for a person should be entered first. +
Sorting by address will display the list with addresses in ascending alphabetical order. +
Sorting by default will do the same as sorting by name currently. +

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of sorting. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Modify list internally and permanently. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement, allows for greater flexibility as the internal list can be modified. +
**Cons:** Unable to re-obtain original list of persons, which is sorted by date added, without changing Person. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify displayed list, only for visual purposes. +
**Pros:** Able to preserve original listing of date added. +
**Cons:** Unable to implement without massive changes as Model's filteredPersonList is immutable and thus cannot
be sorted easily. +

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Sort Command vs List Command +
**Pros:** A user might only want to enter sort once, but does not want to have to enter the entire command again
to obtain the same listing. Thus, Sort Command will sort the list while List Command will redisplay the last sorted list. +
**Cons:** Multiple commands might confuse the user. +

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Display entire list vs Display filtered list +
**Current choice:** Display filtered list
**Pros:** Good for those who want to see the filtered list sorted. Gives list command more value. +
**Cons:** Extra code to remember previous predicate. +

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** FilterType aliases +
**Pros:** Greater flexibility and convenience for the user +
**Cons:** Extra code and variables to maintain +

==== Further enhancements
Sorting by date added by adding a "date added" attribute to each person in the address book. +
Sorting in descending order. +
// end::SortCommand[]

// tag::UserProfile[]
=== AddressBook and UserProfile Storage
The AddressBook and UserProfile data is stored in data/AddressBook.xml and data/UserProfile.xml.

The AddressBook converts all `Persons`, `Tags` and `WebLinks` into XML format, which is then saved to the xml file.
Upon initialising the app, the AddressBook will read the xml file and convert it back to Persons, Tags and Weblink
respectively before setting the data.

Similarly for UserProfile, the UserPerson is stored as an `XMLAdaptedPerson`, saved as an xml file and then retrived
upon initialisation of the app. Whenever the UserPerson is edited using the `Update Command`, the userProfile is saved
to the file.

A UserProfile Window was added as a UI Component to display the User Profile information. Additionally, the User Profile
can be modified from the textfields in the UI directly. The UserProfile is only saved when "OK" is clicked. Invalid values will be detected and changes will not be saved.
The "Enter" key is added as an accelerator for the OK button and the "Escape" key is added as an accelerator for
the cancel button. The UserProfile can be found under "File" --> "User Profile" and has an accelerator

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Choice of location for storing UserProfile Data +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Separately from AddressBook. +
**Justification:** This path was chosen taking into consideration the two following cases:
A User can have multiple AddressBooks, or multiple users can share one AddressBook. +
In the former case, the User would not have to modify his UserProfile for each AddressBook. +
In the latter case, an AddressBook should not be tied to only one UserPerson in particular. +
**Pros:** Greater flexibility, portability +
**Cons:** More code and java classes to maintain, changes the structure of `Model` to support multiple
variables. +
**Alternative 2:** Together with AddressBook +
**Pros:** Easier to manage, with only one Storage file and fewer classes to maintain +
**Cons:** Reduced flexibility as now, both AddressBook data and UserProfile cannot be separated

==== Further enhancements
+ Modify settings and userPrefs in the UserProfile

// end::UserProfile[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
