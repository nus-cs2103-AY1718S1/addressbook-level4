== Introduction

// tag::introduction[]

At the Heart of our Design is the idea that every man wants to be a Gentleman.
Encompassing that idea is a system that respects you as you respect it.
It provides the gentleman with exactly what he needed, when he needs it.
Nothing more, nothing less.

Gentleman's Guide is a contact book for the elite.
It is a command line based programming with a GUI. It it targeted to work for the sophisticated gentleman,
with every aspect of it built to cater to them. The UI captures a Gentleman's eyes from the first moment their eyes gaze upon it.
With rule 18 of the Gentleman staring straight at them, they will forever remember who they are, a Gentleman.

This developer guide will describe the design and implementation of Gentleman's Guide. It will help you understand how Gentleman's Guide works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.
// end::introduction[]

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

First of all, you need to have two of the following:

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Make sure you do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` for Windows/Linux, or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` for macOS
. After that, select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.4 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.0.1 : Inheritance Diagram for Undoable Commands._


As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.0.2 : Stack Diagram for Undoable Commands 1._


As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.0.3 : Stack Diagram for Undoable Commands 2._

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.0.4 : Stack Diagram for Undoable Commands 3._

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.0.5 : Sequence Diagram for Undoable Commands._

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.0.6 : Stack Diagram for Undoable Commands 4._

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.0.7 : Stack Diagram for Undoable Commands 5._

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::PrivateDatabase[]

=== Private Database System

The `Private Database` system is implemented by creating a separate xml database file, similar to the system used in the current
database. To facilitate its implementation, there are account models that allows the user to create a unique account in the
`Unique Account List` with the parameters `Username` and `Password`.
When the Gentleman's Guide is started, the `Main App` searches for an existing account database. If one
is not present, it would load a new account database with a typical account with `Username:` private and `Password:` password.
The `Create Account`, `Login` and `Logout` function extends an abstract `Command` class.



The below shows the inheritance diagram for the abstract `Command` class.

image::Inheritance_Login.JPG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.0.1 : Inheritance Diagram for Private Database Commands._



As it can be seem, `Create Account`, `Login` and `Logout` extends the abstract `Command` class. Thus when the user call
on the according commands, with the right parameters, the `LogicManager` will call on the command to `Execute`.
A detailed explanation of the individual commands can be found below.

==== Create Account

The `Create Account` function is implemented by extending the abstract class `Command`. When the `Create Account` function is entered with the command
`create` and the parameters `u/USERAME` and `p/PASSWORD`, the Gentleman's guide will look through the current accounts for the existence of an account with the same `USERNAME`.
If it exists, it would show a Duplicate Account message. If an account does not exist, it would create the account with the entered parameters.

The below shows the interaction of the features through the multiple components.

image::CreateAccountSequenceDiagram.JPG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1.1 : Interactions in the Create Account Command._



As it can be seen, the `LogicManager` will call on the `CreateAccountCommand` to execute. It will then call on the model
to add and `Account` which would throw a `DuplicateAccountException` if the account already exists. If not, it will update the
`FilteredAccountList` and the `database`.

Thus User can choose to Create an account if he does not already have one, but he will not be able to access the other users database.

==== Login/Logout Function

The Login and Logout function work using similar principles. The functions work using many different components. To facilitate
its implementation there is a `LoginCommand`
inside the `LogicManager` and `AddressBook Parser`. The `LoginCommand` works by taking the input and checking it with a
database of accounts that are available in the separate database created as explained earlier in the Create Function.
If the inputs are verified, it will call upon the `UI` to restart the addressbook application with
the new filepath. The `LogoutCommand` works similar to the `LoginCommand` except that it does not check with the account database.
Instead, the `Logoutcommand` simply  call on the `UI` to restart the addressbook application with its default filepath.

The process of how the feature functions and what would happen is as follows:

image::LoginSequenceDiagram.JPG[width="1000"]
_Figure 4.2.2.1 : Interactions in the Login Command._



As it can be seen, when the `logincommand` is called, if the credentials are correct, it would call on the `UiManager` to restart the application with the user database and model. The `Restart()` method created new user configs, preferences and storage according to the username. It then called on the current `Mainwindow` to close and closes the `primarystage` that the current `Mainwindow` is using. From there, it will call on the `UiManager` to initialise with the user `logic`, user `storage`, user `preferences` and user `config`.

Similiarly, the user can choose to implement the `logoutcommand` which would call on the `restart()` method with the parameter addressbook. The application would then restart and load the public addressbook.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `LoginFunction`. +
**Alternative 1:** Create a whole new `LoginFunction` interface, with its own GUI. +
**Pros:** `LoginFunction will have separate User profile and database. It would be a more versatile application. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement and even harder to test. +
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement a `LoginCommand` function at the `CommandBox`. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. Achieves the basic functions of security. +
**Cons:** Does not look as good.

**Aspect:** Implementation of `Private Database`. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Private Database` from scratch. +
**Pros:** `Database` will build on the current data storing methods. Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** Not as secure. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement a `Private Database` using a MySql Database.+
**Pros:** More secure, a more widely used method. +
**Cons:** Less code to write as most of it would be pre-written and in built into MySql.

**Aspect:** Implementation of `Private Database` as `UndoableCommand` or `Command`. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Command`. +
**Pros:** `Database` more reliable and less complicated. +
**Cons:** Less versatility. +
**Alternative 2:** `UndoableCommand`. +
**Pros:** More versatility, allows for easy undo of accidental accounts. +
**Cons:** Increased complication, allowing for potential errors that the `Undo` command would work in the wrong database.

// end::PrivateDatabase[]

// tag::birthday[]
=== Birthday

==== BirthdayCommand

`BirthdayCommand` : It allows the adding, editing and removing of birthday parameter to/from a person. +


The `BirthdayCommand` lies in the `commands` of `Logic`. and deals with `UndoableCommands`, thus the actions can
be reversed.  The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::birthdayLogic.png[width="900"]
_Figure 4.3.1.1 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component._

You will not be able to enter the birthday parameter when adding contacts. +
Suppose that you have a list of persons. The birthday parameters of each contact will be empty if you have not modified them before. +
You can then choose to add their birthday using the BirthdayCommand. For example if you want to add the birthday (20/07/1994) of the
second person in your contact list, key in " `birthday 2 b/20/07/1994` "  +
Similarly, you can edit their birthday using the same command. +
To delete their birthday, simply not key in anything for his birthday. For example,
" `birthday 2 b/` "

The following sequence diagram shows how the birthday operation works:

image::birthdaySD.png[width="900"]
_Figure 4.3.1.2 : Interactions in the Birthday Command._

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Adding Birthday parameter +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add birthday parameter separately after person object is created. +
**Pros:** Lesser parameters to add while creating person class and easier to implement. +
**Cons:** Slower for users to add in all the parameters. +
**Alternative 2:**  Add birthday parameter during the creation of person object. +
**Pros:** Faster for users to add in all the parameters. +
**Cons:** More parameters to add while creating person class and harder to implement. +

---
**Aspect:** Birthday commands with specific uses +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only one birthday command to add / edit / delete birthday from person. +
**Pros:** Convenient, lesser commands for users to remember. +
**Cons:** Birthday command is very general and may be confusing to the user instead. +
**Alternative 2:**  Create other commands such as editBirthday and deleteBirthday. +
**Pros:** Less convenient, many commands for users to remember. +
**Cons:** Each command is specific and purpose of each command is clear. +

// end::birthday[]

// tag::taggingfunctions[]
=== Tags Manipulation & Retrieve mechanism

Three commands for tags manipulation, namely `TagCommand`, `UntagCommand` and `RetagCommand`, together with `RetrieveCommand`, all reside in the `commands` of `Logic`.

==== Tag command

Tag command allows user to assign tags to the persons at the specified index in the last person listing.

This command inherits from `UndoableCommand`. Thus, the tagging action can be undone.

For every person at the index specified, a `Person` object with the updated tag list will be created and the `updatePerson()` method of `Model` will be called to replace the person inside `AddressBook` 's person list with the new person object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag operation works:

image::TagSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1.1 : Interactions in the Tag Command._

==== Untag command

Untag command allows user to remove tags from the persons at the specified index in the last person listing.
In addition, user can choose to:

* Remove all tags from the persons at the specified index in the last person listing.
* Remove the specified tags from all persons in the last person listing.
* Remove all tags from all persons in the last person listing.

This command inherits from `UndoableCommand`. Thus, the untagging action can be undone.

Compared to `TagCommand`, `UntagCommand` has a boolean attribute called `toAllInFilteredList` to indicate whether untagging will be applied
to all persons in filtered list or not.

The following sequence diagram shows how the untag operation works:

image::UntagSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.2.1 : Interactions in the Untag Command._

Similar to tag command operation, for every person that will be untagged, a `Person` object with the updated tag list will be created and the `updatePerson()` method of `Model` will be called to replace the person inside `AddressBook` 's person list with the new person object.

After having updated all relevant persons, `UntagCommand` will utilize `deleteUnusedTag()` of `Model` to remove any unused `Tag` inside `AddressBook` 's unique tag list.

==== Retag command

Retag command allows user to rename an existing tag to a new tag name.

This command inherits from `UndoableCommand`. Thus, the retagging action can be undone.

At the beginning of its execution, the command updates person filterd list with all persons inside the addressbook by calling `updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` of `Model`.
After that, it will loop through the filtered list and perform update on persons with the specified old tag name similar to how `TagCommand` and `UntagCommand` updates persons.

After having updated the person list of `AddressBook` where necessary, `RetagCommand` will call `deleteUnusedTag()` of `Model` on the old `Tag` to remove it from `AddressBook` 's unique tag list.

==== Retrieve command

Retrieve command allows user to list all persons that have been assigned a tag already existing inside the unique tag list.

This command inherits from `Command`, so retrieving cannot be undone.

Suppose that the address book already has a sufficiently large number of persons, some of whom have a certain `Tag`. The `UniqueTagList` will contain this tag. +

The user wants to quickly find out all of the those persons with this tag, so he decides to use `retrieve`.

We will now parse the command argument to get the name of the tag which user want to use `retrieve` on.

[NOTE]
If the tag name provided by user is empty or invalid, an `Exception` will be thrown during parsing.

We use `TagContainsKeyWordPredicate` to test whether the tag is inside the tag list of each person in the address book and get the filtered person list with `updateFilteredPersonList()` of `Model` to display to user.

[NOTE]
If the filtered person list is empty, that means the tag user want to look for does not exist. User will then be notified of all existing tags.

The following sequence diagram shows how the retrieve operation works:

image::RetrieveSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.4.1 : Sequence Diagram for the Retrieve Command._

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Adding tags to person's tag list +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Set` to implement person's tag list and to store tags to be added during command parsing. +
**Pros:** Duplicated tags will be automatically taken care of. +
**Cons:** The order of tags inside person's tag list is not maintained. Users may want the tags of their contacts
to be arranged according to the time added. +
**Alternative 2:**  Using `List` implement person's tag list and to store tags to be added. +
**Pros:** Full control over the order of tags inside person's tag list. +
**Cons:** Duplicated tags need to be handled manually. +

---

**Aspect:** Finding out all persons with the specififed tag +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Go through every person in the addressbook to filter out those having the tag. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Slower if the addressbook contains a large number of persons +
**Alternative 2:**  Create a list attribute for `Tag` to store all persons currently having that tag. +
**Pros:** Faster to get the persons as the filtered person list is already created. +
**Cons:** Requires to save the lists of all existing tags to storage file. +
// end::taggingfunctions[]

// tag::viewcommand[]
=== View profile mechanism

View command allows user to see all details of a contact in full view.
Its benefit will be shown more clearly in later releases of Gentleman's Guide when various new contact fields have been added. +

When executed, `ViewCommand` raises a `ShowProfileRequestEvent` and calls `post()` of `EventCenter` to post the event to all registered subscribers.
The subscribers of `BrowserPanel` will then be notified of the event and handle it by calling `handleShowProfileRequestEvent()`,
which closes any children currently opening inside `BrowserPanel` and attempts to load `PersonProfile` onto the panel.
// end::viewcommand[]

=== Reminder list

The `Reminder` list mechanism works similar to the `Person` list. +
It integrates the `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage`, `UI` component. +
It consists of different commands that allow users to store reminders into the address book.
The commands reside in the `commands` of `Logic` +

==== AddReminderCommand
Adds information of reminders in address book. +
e.g. `addReminder z/Proposal Submission p/Low d/12/11/2017 m/Submit to Manager t/Friends` +

==== EditReminderCommand

==== EditReminderCommand
`EditReminderCommand`: Edits the details of reminders in address book. +
e.g. `editReminder 2 p/Medium m/Submit to Department Head`

==== DeleteReminderCommand

`DeleteReminderCommand`: Deletes the reminder of the last reminder list. +
e.g. `deleteReminder 3`

==== SortPriorityCommand

`SortPriorityCommand`: Sorts the reminder list in order of `priority` . +
(Will be covered more in sort Mechanism)

==== FindReminderCommand and FindPriorityCommand

`findReminder` : Finds the reminder that contains the keyword. +
`findPriority` : Finds the reminders that contains the keyword. +
(Will be covered more in Find Mechanism)

// tag::listReminder[]
==== listReminderCommand

`listReminder` : Lists all the reminders in the reminder list. +
e.g. `listReminder`

// end::listReminder[]

[NOTE]
Missing details during adding of reminders will result in Invalid Command format.

[NOTE]
If an invalid Index is given during editing and deleting reminders, an `Exception` would be thrown.


// tag::find[]
=== Find Mechanism

==== findPhoneCommand

Finds contact with the phone number given. +
e.g. `findPhone 87654321`

==== findEmailCommand

Finds the contact with the email given. +
e.g. `findEmail alex@example.com`

==== findReminderCommand

Finds reminder(s) with same task name as the keyword given. +
e.g. `findReminder project`

==== findPriorityCommand

Finds reminder(s) with the priority (Low / Medium / High) given. +
e.g. `findPriority High`

The 4 advanced find commands, as well as the original `find` command lies in the `commands` of `Logic`. and does not deal
with `UndoableCommands`, thus the actions cannot be reversed. +
The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for `findPhone` command:

image::findPhoneSD.png[width="900"]
_Figure 4.7.4.1 Interactions in the findPhone command._

Suppose the user keys in the command (e.g. `findReminder Proposal`) to search for all his reminders with the keyword
"Proposal". The application searches through the entire reminder list and displays all reminders
with the keyword.

image::BeforeAndAfterFindReminder.png[width=850"]
_Figure 4.7.4.2 Reminder list before and after the findReminder command_


[NOTE]
====
- Only keywords are searched, incomplete keywords in command such as `findEmail alex@example` will not return contact
with email "alex@example.com". +
- All find commands are case insensitive (e.g. "high" will match "High"). +
====

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Number of Find command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Different find commands for each purpose +
**Pros:** Fast and direct, convenient for user. +
**Cons:** Many find commands for users to remember / Users may need to check for user guide or help function very often
 to see the types of find commands available. +
**Alternative 2:**  Users key in the word "find", application then shows the types of find available and users selects
the type of find command he wants +
**Pros:** Lesser commands to remember and checks user guide less often. +
**Cons:** Slower and less direct. +

---

// end::find[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting Mechanism

==== sortCommand

Sorts the contact list in alphabetical order. +
e.g. `sort`

==== sortAgeCommand

Sorts the contact list in order of their age, from the oldest to youngest. +
e.g. `sortAge`

==== sortBirthdayCommand

Sorts the contact list in from 1st January to 31st December, irregardless of their age. +
e.g. `sortBirthday`

==== sortPriority

Sorts the reminder list in order of the task priority. (*High* -> *Medium* -> *Low*) +
e.g. `sortPriority`

The 4 sort commands support undoing and redoing of commands, similar to add, edit and delete commands.
It inherits from `UndoableCommand` and uses the `Collection` class. +
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the execute("sort") API call.

image::sortSD.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.8.4.1 Interactions in the sort command._

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Number of Sort command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Different sort commands for each purpose +
**Pros:** Fast and direct, convenient for user. +
**Cons:** Many sort commands for users to remember / Users may need to check for user guide or help function very often
 to see the types of sort commands available. +
**Alternative 2:**  Users key in the word "sort", application then shows the types of sort available and users selects
the type of sort command he wants +
**Pros:** Lesser commands to remember and checks user guide less often. +
**Cons:** Slower and less direct. +

---

// end::sort[]

// tag::selectReminder[]

==== Select Reminder
Clicking on any of the `Reminder` card or typing the command `selectReminder` followed by the index of the `Reminder` card will expand its details. The expanded
details would be displayed beside it. +
It allow viewing of the entire `message` field if it is too long.

===== Implementation

The `Select Reminder` is implemented using event handlers. Clicking on the `Reminder` card or typing the `selectReminder` command
will call different select reminder event. The subscribers to the events in the `BrowserPanel` class will receive the event and call on the `BrowserPanel` to load the
appropriate `Reminder` card to display.

// end::selectReminder[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.3.1 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

You can take a look at <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  First, update the version number of your address book in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Next, generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  After that, tag the repo with the version number you are at now. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

_Figure A.1.3 : Before after StatusBarFooter component_

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
