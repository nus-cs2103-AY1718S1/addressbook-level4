* If you are ready to contribute, make a pull request (pr) on our main repository.
** First time making a pr? There's a great guide for beginners over https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github[here]
* Lastly, if you have any questions, feel free to https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B4/main/issues[make an issue] or <<ContactUs#, contact us>> directly.

==== Experienced Developers
Thank you for taking the time to look at our project. While we have worked on this extensively, do let us know what can be improved!
Your experience and contribution will be invaluable in improving Unify for our valued users.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// tag::find[]

=== Find by Person Details

Unify offers users the option to find people by their details. To implement the new command syntax,
`FindCommandParser` makes use of the `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize` to generate an `ArgumentMultimap`. The `ArgumentMultimap's`
`key` contains the detail's prefix and `value` contains the keywords that succeed that prefix.

For each detail, there are specific `Predicates` that are defined. They are `AddressContainsKeywordPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordPredicate`,
`NameContainsKeywordPredicate`, `PhoneContainsKeywordPredicate` and `TagsContainKeywordPredicate`, `RemarkContainsKeywordPredicate`. The implementation is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class DetailContainsKeywordPredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {

    ...

    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        String detail = person.getDetail(); //getter for person's specific detail

        //we convert detail to lowercase and check if it contains the lower case keyword
        return detail.toLowerCase().contains(keyword.toLowerCase());
    }

}

----
[NOTE]
For Tags, we test for all tags and check for at least one `String#contains` match. For Remark, we check using `StringUtil#containsWordIgnoreCase`.


However, just having a specific `Predicate` for each detail is insufficient as `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()`
only takes only a single `Predicate` as an argument.
As such, to accept multiple details in one query, we need to encapsulate multiple `Predicates` into one `Predicate`.
This is encapsulated by `PersonContainsFieldsPredicate` which takes in a list of `Predicates` as an argument.

Internally, the `Predicates` are stored in a `HashSet`.

[source,java]
----
public class PersonContainsFieldsPredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {

    ...

    public PersonContainsFieldsPredicate(List<Predicate> predicates) {
        this.predicates = predicates.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet()); //Collects in a HashSet
    }

    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        for (Predicate searchQuery : predicates) {
            if (!searchQuery.test(person)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
----

For `PersonContainsFieldsPredicate#test` we iterate through all `Predicates` and return `false` if any of their `#test` calls return false. Thus this `Predicate` will check for all matches before return `true` (ie an *AND* find).
Consider a `PersonContainsFieldsPredicate p` with `NameContainsKeywordPredicate n`, `AddressContainsKeywordPredicate a` and a `ReadOnlyPerson rop`. `rop's` `Name` contains keyword found in `n` but `Address` does not contain the keyword found in `a`.
The following sequence diagram shows `p` being tested on `rop`.

image::PersonContainsFieldsPredicate.png[width="800"]

We can pass this `PersonContainsFieldsPredicate` into `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` which updates `FilteredList` the with the new `Predicate` which updates
the list to suit the parameters of the find query.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storing of `Predicates` in `PersonContainsFieldsPredicate` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store in a `HashSet` +
**Pros:** We can filter out duplicate `Predicates`. `equals()` implementation is cleaner. +
**Cons:** Must override `hashCode()` for new `Predicate`. Constructor must iterate through list to create `Set`. +
**Alternative 2:** Store in a `List` +
**Pros:** Do not need to override `hashCode()` for new `Predicate`. Constructor only needs to assign constructor arguments. +
**Cons:** `equals()` results in O(n^2^) execution. Also results in 2 nested `for` loops. +

---

**Aspect:** Encapsulation of multiple `Predicates` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create different `Predicates` and wrap them in one `Predicate` +
**Pros:** Modular code: we can easily implement an *OR* find by creating a new wrapper `Predicate` and reusing the existing `Predicates`. `PersonContainsFieldsPredicate`
does not have to be aware of new `Predicates` +
**Cons:** Every new field in `ReadOnlyPerson` requires a new `Predicate` +
**Alternative 2:** Create one `Predicate` that implements test by switch statements +
**Pros:** A new field can be added by adding an additional case to the switch statement +
**Cons:** Implementing *OR* find will require the reuse of switch statements in a new `Predicate`. When creating a new `Predicate`, all the switch
 statements must be updated. +

---
// end::find[]

// tag::musiccommand[]
=== Music Player Mechanism
The `music` command is extended with an additional command behind it. For example, `music play`, has `play` as the extended command. The `play` command at the back means that the system will play a music track. While `music stop` command
will stop the current music track.

Both the `music play` and the `music stop` commands are executed in the same `MusicCommand` class. This also makes the commands easier to remember for the user as well, as anything related to `music` will start with `music` as a command.

Additional extended commands can be added by having an additional case in the switch statement, as the extended commands are handled in a switch statement.
In addition, the `MusicCommand` class will create a new `music thread`, this is to prevent the User Interface from being non-responsive in the current thread. Currently, all music played will be in a loop until it is stopped by the user, through the `music stop` command.

[source,java]
----
music = new Music("audio/music/" + genre + trackNumber + ".mp3");
music.start();
----

{sp}

image::header_note.png[width="400"]

* If you wish to include more music tracks, you also have to change the variable `maxTrackNumber = 2` to the desired number. For example, if you wish to have 3 music tracks for each genre, you have to change it to `maxTrackNumber = 3`
and ensure that each genre has at least 3 music tracks in the `resources/audio/music` folder. As shown below, `maxTrackNumber` is used to check for last track number in the playlist. This is to reset the track number back to 1,
 when the user decides plays the next music track.

[source,java]
----
if (trackNumber < maxTrackNumber) {
    trackNumber++;
} else {
    //reset track number back to 1
    trackNumber = 1;
}
----

{sp}

* You are also able to add a new genre of music. However make sure that it too has the equal number of music tracks as the other genres. In addition, you have to update the `GENRE_LIST` array to include the new genre that you have just added.

[source,java]
----
public static final String[] GENRE_LIST = {"pop", "dance", "classic"};
----

{sp}


The following sequence diagram shows how the music operation works:

image::DG_seq_music.png[width="900"]

{sp}

The following activity diagram summarises what happens inside the `MusicCommand` class when a user executes a new command: +

It first has to check the extended command, whether it is a `play` or a `stop` command. It then checks if is there any music or radio player is already currently playing, if it does, it stops the current music/radio player.
Next, it checks if the user has input any `[GENRE]` and play that chosen `[GENRE]` music, otherwise, the default "pop" `[GENRE]` music will be played.

image::DG_activitydiagram_music.png[width="700"]

{sp}

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

The music player function requires an external library. You have to add `compile group: 'com.googlecode.soundlibs', name: 'jlayer', version: '1.0.1-1'` to your dependencies in `build.gradle` file. as shown below.

[source,java]
----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.googlecode.soundlibs', name: 'jlayer', version: '1.0.1-1'
}
----

{sp}

image::header_warning.png[width="400"]

* The `trackNumber` has to be less than or equal to the number of each genre tracks you have in the `resources/audio/music` folder. For example, if `trackNumber` is 2, it is required to have at least 2 mp3 files of each genre of music.

image::MusicList.jpg[width="200"]

* The `resources/audio/music` folder cannot be empty.

* You can only add music tracks that are encoded in .mp3 format.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Naming of music tracks +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Name begins with the genre followed by track number +
**Pros:** Easy to maintain, as it allows the addition of music tracks by adding more mp3 files and a change of only one or two variables in the code. +
**Cons:** Require to have the same exact number of music tracks for each genre +

**Alternative 2:** Any file name  +
**Pros:** Able to hold music track title name, which can be used to display to the user in the result box +
**Cons:** Requires an array to keep track of the music tracks for each genre. More code manipulation required when adding more music tracks +

{sp}

**Aspect:** Which music file to play first +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Play the music file that starts with 1 then increases from there +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. Users are able to know what song is coming up next on the tracklist +
**Cons:** Always start playing the same music track first +

**Alternative 2:** Play a random music file +
**Pros:** Has a chance to be different the next time the user starts playing music. +
**Cons:** User does not know which song is going to be played next.

---
// end::musiccommand[]

// tag::radiocommand[]
=== Radio Player Mechanism
The `radio` command is extended with an additional command behind it. For example, `radio play`, has `play` as the extended command. The `play` command at the back means that the system will play a radio broadcast channel. While `radio stop` command
will stop the current radio player.

Both the `radio play` and the `radio stop` commands are executed in the same `RadioCommand` class. This also makes the commands easier to remember for the user as well, as anything related to `radio` will start with `radio` as a command.
In addition, the `RadioCommand` class will create a new `radio thread`, this is to prevent the User Interface from being non-responsive in the current thread. The radio thread will stream endlessly unless the stream has been shut down.
Hence, the radio thread will only be closed when the user executes the `radio stop` command.

image::header_note.png[width="400"]

* If you wish to include more radio broadcast station, just simply modify `radio.java` class as shown below, and add new case into the switch statement, with a valid url that streams in .mp3 codec.
* Do note that only .mp3 stream URLs can be used.

[source,java]

The following sequence diagram shows how the radio operation works:

image::DG_seq_radio.png[width="900"]

{sp}

The following activity diagram summarises what happens inside the `RadioCommand` class when a user executes a new command:

It first has to check the extended command, whether it is a `play` or a `stop` command. It then checks if is there any music or radio player is already currently playing, if it does, it stops the current music/radio player.
Next, it checks if the user has an Internet connection. It also check if the user has input any `[GENRE]` and play that chosen `[GENRE]` radio broadcast, otherwise, the default "pop" `[GENRE]` broadcast will be played.

image::DG_activitydiagram_radio.png[width="700"]

{sp}

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

The radio streaming function requires an external library. You have to add `compile group: 'com.googlecode.soundlibs', name: 'jlayer', version: '1.0.1-1'` to your dependencies in `build.gradle` file. as shown below.

[source,java]
----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.googlecode.soundlibs', name: 'jlayer', version: '1.0.1-1'
}
----

{sp}

This library is required as it can convert input stream into .mp3 codec immediately.

image::header_warning.png[width="400"]

* In order for the radio player to work, it requires an Internet connection, as it streams the radio broadcast through the Internet.
* Remember to check the status of the stream URLs. As it is possible but highly unlikely that one of those radio broadcast has been shut down.

// tag::sharecommand[]
=== Share Contacts by Email Mechanism

The `share` command takes in the parameter that consists an `INDEX`, of which is the selected contact's details to be shared with.
Followed by s/`INDEX` `EMAIL`, which are the parameters for the recipient email address. This format allows the parameters `INDEX` `EMAIL` found are interchangeable.

By using the `isNumeric(string)` method, which returns us a boolean. If it returns true, it means that input is an `INDEX`, otherwise, it is a string.
Next, we want to check if those string values are indeed valid email addresses, use the isValidEmailAddress(string) to check whether is it a valid email address.
This method requires the use of `javax.mail` API, as it creates a new `InternetAddress` object and calls `validate()' method to check if the email address is valid or not.

Once, we know the email address are valid. We have to create a new thread to send these emails. Because, if we were to send more than 2 emails,
the main thread for the UI will be non-responsive.

image::header_note.png[width="400"]

* If you wish to change to a different host email address, just simply modify `sendEmail.java` class as shown below, and change the variable values, such as senderEmail, password, and the host.
* If your sender's email is from `Gmail`, your host has to be `smtp.gmail.com`
* If your sender's email is from `Outlook`, your host has to be `smtp-mail.outlook.com`
* If your sender's email is from `Hotmail`, your host has to be `smtp.live.com`

The following activity diagram summarises what happens inside the `ShareCommand` class when a user executes a new command:

It first has to check the `INDEX` of the selected contact. Next, it reads the `INDEX` and gets that contact's details.
Then, it checks for the arguments, whether is it a numeric valid index or just a string. It also validates the recipients' email addresses.
Lastly, it checks for an Internet connection and sends the email if so.

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies

The sharing of contacts by email function requires an external library. You have to add `compile 'javax.mail:mail:1.4.7'` to your dependencies in `build.gradle` file. as shown below.

dependencies {
    compile 'javax.mail:mail:1.4.7'

* In order for the sharing of contacts feature to work, it requires Internet connection first, as it's main function requires to sends an email to the recipients.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** What to use for subject header in email +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Fixed subject header +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. Prevent of abuse of subject header to send negative subject headers +
**Cons:** Always the same subject header +

**Alternative 2:** Let user input the subject header +
**Pros:** Different subject header can be used for different purpose. +
**Cons:** Can be abused to send offensive subject headers, leading to a bad reputation for Unify, as the recipients think that the offensive subject header is from Unify.

// end::sharecommand[]

// tag::audiblefeedback[]
=== Audible Feedback Mechanism
Audio feedback is created by using two different audio cues. First is the typing sound, that is created by playing a .mp3 sound file using the `Audio.java` class. You may use this class to play a sound file without looping. You just have to create a new `Audio`
object with an `audioFileName` of which is your .mp3 resource file.

The second audio cue comes from the Text-To-Speech feature, which plays an human-like speech back to the user when they have successfully executed a command.
This can be easily added to any new commands by creating a new `TextToSpeech` object with the string `word` that you want it to speak. Next call the `TextToSpeech.speak()` method to run the Text-To-Speech feature.

For example, `new TextToSpeech("hello").speak();` will cause the system to say "hello" when it is executed.

==== Prerequisites/Dependencies
The audio play back function requires an external library. You have to add `compile group: 'com.googlecode.soundlibs', name: 'jlayer', version: '1.0.1-1'` to your dependencies in `build.gradle` file. as shown below.

[source,java]

dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.googlecode.soundlibs', name: 'jlayer', version: '1.0.1-1'

{sp}

The Text-To-Speech feature requires an external library. You have to add `compile 'javax.mail:mail:1.4.7'` to your dependencies +
and `url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"` to your maven repositories in `build.gradle` file. as shown below.

    compile group: 'org.jvoicexml', name: 'cmu_time_awb', version: '1.2.3-SNAPSHOT'
}

----

{sp}

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** When to use Text-To-Speech audio feedback +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Successful and unsuccessful command execution excluding invalid commands +
**Pros:** Giving audible feedback when users needed it the most, such as confirmation of successful command execution +
**Cons:** Invalid commands have no audio feedback +

**Alternative 2:** All commands, including invalid commands, have audio feedback +
**Pros:** Users able to have audible feedback for every action they take +
**Cons:** Users may find it annoying as every action they take, the system will play an audio cue. +

// end::audiblefeedback[]

---

// tag::validation[]
=== Command Box Validation

We validate the user's command as he is typing, which allows real-time feedback to the user on whether
their command is valid.

This is done by listening to the `TextField` associated to `CommandBox`. Whenever there is a change in
input of the `TextField`, we call `setStyleByValidityOfInput`. As we have a reference to the `LogicMangager`
(which is used for undo/redo), we can just run `LogicManager#parse` to check if the current input is valid,
and style the input box accordingly.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Listen to `CommandBox` input's changes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Listen directly to `commandTextField`. +
**Pros:** No coupling with `EventsCenter`. +
**Cons:** Inconsistent with implementation of other features (e.g. hints, command box icon). +
**Alternative 2:** Subscribe to `CommandInputChangedEvent`. +
**Pros:** Easily extensible as logic can be extracted into another class. +
**Cons:** Adds additional dependency to `EventsCenter`. +
// end::validation[]

---

// tag::commandboxicon[]
=== Command Box Icon

In addition to styling the command box, we also show the user icons matching their command on the right
of the command box.

We leverage a third-party library called link:https://github.com/aalmiray/ikonli[Ikonli]. We add a new
JavaFX component, `CommandBoxIcon`, which subscribes to `CommandInputChangedEvent` and calls
`parseCommandAndArguments`, and passes the returned `commandWord` into `parseIconCode`, which then returns
an `Ikon`, which we display.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Where to get icons +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Ikonli`, a third-party library. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Adds additional third-party dependency. +
**Alternative 2:** Embed them as images or icons. +
**Pros:** Easy to customize, as icons are all embedded images. +
**Cons:** Reinvents the wheel. +
// end::commandboxicon[]

---

// tag::alias[]
=== Aliases

We implement aliases by adding a new `Aliases` class to the `UserPrefs` model. Since `UserPrefs` is saved
to file, aliases will persist through application restarts.

`Aliases` contains a `HashMap<String, String>` which maps `alias -> command`. This allows us to find the
matching command in amortized O(1) time. By default, `Aliases` contains a map of synonyms for frequently
used commands. For example, `new -> add`, `remove -> delete`, `show -> list`, etc.

We added a new parser, `parseCommandAndArguments` in `ParserUtil` that parses user input into a `commandWord` and `arguments`, which
`AddressBookParser` uses. To allow access to the `UserPrefs` instance in `ParserUtil`, we changed `UserPrefs`
into a link:#singleton[Singleton]. `parseCommandAndArguments` refers to the `Aliases` instance inside `UserPrefs`
and returns the mapped command.

This simplified sequence diagram shows how `parseCommandAndArguments` work:

image::AliasSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Accessing `UserPrefs` from `ParserUtil` and other classes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Turn `UserPrefs` into a Singleton +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. Minimise code change across code base. +
**Cons:** Increases coupling. Difficult to stub in testing. Does not reset between tests. +
**Alternative 2:** Pass the `UserPrefs` instance down to the parser +
**Pros:** Less coupling. Follows Law of Demeter. +
**Cons:** Heavy changes to code base to pass the instance downstream. +
// end::alias[]

___

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete

We implement autocompletion by introducing a new class: `Autocomplete`. This class contains all the
utility methods required for obtaining an appropriate autocompletion from a given user input. The
main method is `autocomplete(String input)`. This takes in the user's input and attempts to generate
a hint from it. As we need to display the autocompletion in the command box hints, this reduces
duplicated code required for producing the autocompletion.

There are several other utility methods in the class, such as `autocompleteFromList`, which takes in
an input and an array of strings, and returns the first command that contains input as a prefix, or
`autocompleteCommand`, which takes in a command word and compares it with a list of all commands and
aliases, and autocompletes the command.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user presses `Tab`:

image::AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Degree of coupling between Autocomplete and Hints. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Share logic by coupling both classes. +
**Pros:** Minimize code duplication, as logic can be shared. +
**Cons:** Increases coupling. Difficult to stub in testing. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement the logic in both classes. +
**Pros:** Less coupling. +
**Cons:** Increase chance of regression if only one class is changed. +
// end::autocomplete[]

---

=== Listening for Input Change

When the `CommandTextField` detects a change in its input, it will raise a `CommandInputChangedEvent`.
The `CommandInputChangedEvent` will contain `currentInput` of the `CommandTextField`.

[source, java]
----
public class CommandInputChangedEvent extends BaseEvent {

    public final String currentInput;

    public CommandInputChangedEvent(String newCurrentInput) {
        currentInput = newCurrentInput;
    }

    //... mandatory event logic
}
----

Components that adjust based on change in input, for example inline hints, can simply subscribe to this event.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to inform other components on input change +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Raise an event +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. Less coupling with other components +
**Cons:** Many Events raised which crowds logging.  +
**Alternative 2:** Add other component's method directly to `CommandTextField` text property listener +
**Pros:** No events raised. Has access to `CommandTextField` instance +
**Cons:** Increases coupling. Difficult to pass instance of other components to `CommandTextField` +

___

// tag::inline-hints[]
=== Displaying Inline Hints

==== Inspiration
We wish to display hints similar to how Apple's Spotlight displays their completion and hints.

image::AppleSpotlightSuggestions.jpg[width="600"]

[[inline-hint-terms]]
==== Terms
As of v1.5, an inline hint consists of a concatenation of an argument hint and a description.
An argument hint is an inline suggestion for the next letters to type. For example **add |** n/, n/ being the argument hint.
A description would describe the details of the current command you are typing.

Please refer to the illustration below.

image::InlineHintsArgumentAndDescription.png[width="800"]

==== How we implemented it
In `JavaFX` it is not possible to have a prompt text next to user's input in a `TextField`.

In Unify, we have two `JavaFX` `TextFields` side by side. The input is keyed in the `CommandTextField` `TextField` while the inline hints are set in the `CommandBoxHints` `TextField`. These `TextFields` are placed in `HBox` and thus will not overlap.

At the start, the `CommandTextField` will be empty and length 0.

image::InlineHintsStart.png[width="800"]
As the user keys in the input `CommandTextField` will grow based on the text keyed in with the the help of `TextUtil` methods. As the `CommandTextField` grows, the `HBox` will automatically push the `CommandBoxHints` to the right.

image::InlineHintsTextFieldGrow.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
We clamp the size of the `CommandTextField` to half of the window size so that we have sufficient room for the hints.

image::InlineHintsWindowSize.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Calculating displacement of hints to simulate inline hints +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Put two resizeable `TextFields` side by side. Let the `HBox` handle the displacement +
**Pros:** We have control on how big the `TextFields` can be. +
**Cons:**  Difficult to test the resize calculation as font rendered is different according to OS. Difficult to implement as we have to account for user clicking/tabbing into the `CommandBoxHints` +
**Alternative 2:** Overlay a label over the `CommandTextField`. The label will contain the user input + the inline hint  +

image::InlineHintsOverlay.png[width="400"]
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Hints and Text mis-align when user input exceeds the length of the `TextField`, unable to find work around. +

___

// end::inline-hints[]

=== Hints and Autocomplete Parsing
Inline hints and tab autocompletion of user input is encapsulated by a `Hint` object.
A `Hint` object will take in the current user input and/or other arguments (depending on the implementation of the concrete Hint).

Inline hints can be accessed from `getArgumentHint()` and `getDescription()`.
The next user input on tab can be accessed from `autocomplete()`.

Different commands have similar command format. Hence we separate some of the `Hints` to inherit from
subclasses `FixedArgumentsHint`, `NoArgumentsHint`, `ArgumentsHint` to reuse the same logic.

The inheritance diagram is shown below:

image::HintsClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Why separate argument hints and description
For explanation on what argument hints and description are, click link:#inline-hint-terms[here].

We separate the hint like so for 2 reasons:

. We can style the text differently (for v2.0)
.. In the `CommandTextField` our argument hints should be the same size as our input while our description, which can get quite lengthy, can be smaller in size
.. We can also have the description displayed in a separate component
. The `autocomplete()` output and argument hints are closely related.
.. For many commands, we would want to autocomplete the argument hint. (eg. completing to the next prefix)

// tag::avatar[]

=== Avatar

When users add a contact, they have an option to specify an avatar for the person. If entered with a valid
path to a .jpg or .png, the image is stored under `data/images/avatars/` with a unique string id using Java's `UUID`.

The `Avatar` will store the unique string id with its file format (eg UUID.png) as its value. +

For contacts who were not given an `Avatar`. Their `Avatar` field will be an empty string. When selected, these people will have a default avatar.
The activity diagram when a person is selected is shown below.

image::GetAvatarActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to save image +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Duplicate image is saved with a unique string id under data +
**Pros:** Application is easily portable - all image files stored in data folder +
**Cons:** Many images are created after multiple testing. (images won't have the same name) +
**Alternative 2:** The absolute file path of the image is saved. When avatar needs to be displayed, the image will be fetched from there. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Application is not portable. If the jar and data files are transferred to a different computer, the `Avatar` loaded will be the default one. +
**Alternative 3:** Use online link to images +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Application is not portable as it requires internet connection +

___

// end::avatar[]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
