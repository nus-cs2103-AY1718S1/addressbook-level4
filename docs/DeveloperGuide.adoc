By: `Team T12-B1`      Since: `Sept 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::group[]
=== Grouping mechanism

// tag::groupjustification[]

==== Groups vs Tags
* Conceptually different. Groups are long-term, standalone constructs, while Tags are individual Person's attributes
* Groups have attributes (number of members)
* Groups can be listed together with their members +
* Subgroups can be created +
Listing, subgroups and group attributes TBI in v2.0

// end::groupjustification[]

==== Big picture
Group class diagram (note that attributes, classes and methods not relevant for the groups are omitted):

image::GroupClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

How grouping is executed, sequence diagram:

image::GroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Note that AddressBook further updates the Person's references to the groups.
`filtered` denotes the Person extracted by applying the index filtering. +

See also the object diagrams showing the process of ungrouping: link:#Ungroup[Ungroup diagram] in appendix

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Storing information about group members +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Members store list of groups they belong to +
**Pros:** Code related to the tags (filtering, storing) can be reused +
**Cons:** Finding the members of specific group more computationally expensive. +
 Information about groups has to be added wherever Person is used (add, edit commands). Some code duplicated +
**Alternative 2:** Group stores list of members +
**Pros:** Easier to understand. Easier to retrieve all the members of a group +
**Cons:** Even though some mechanisms are similar to ones related to Tag, new classes are needed to handle them.

---
**Aspect:** Managing groups +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Groups can be managed (members added, removed) only using group-specific commands +
**Pros:** Avoids cluttering other commands (add, edit).
 Separates the concepts of Person and Group, also Tag and Group. +
**Cons:** Adding a Person to a group at the moment of the Person's creation is impossible +
**Alternative 2:** Groups are accessed and managed just as Tags, when managing a Person +
**Pros:** Avoids creation of a new command. +
**Cons:** Adds another attribute to a Person increasing its complexity.
Not intuitive to manage group by managing Person.

// end::group[]

// tag::profile[]

=== Profile Pictures
Profile pictures are meant to be stored by app (in v.1.5 by the user at his own discretion) and they are added to the app
by specifying the correct path to the file. In case the picture cannot be accessed later, it is not displayed.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Place of picture storage +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pictures are stored by the app after a successful load +
**Pros:** In case the user moves the pictures or the app to another device, pictures are not lost +
**Cons:** Data may be duplicated on the user's computer (stored both by the app and the user). Implementation harder.  +
**Alternative 2:** Pictures stored by the user +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. Easier to understand +
**Cons:** May cause unwanted behavior if user is unaware and moves the pictures from the original location

---
**Aspect:** Format of stored pictures +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pictures are stored in their original format +
**Pros:** Easier to understand. User can access and modify the stored data easily +
**Cons:** Differs from storage of the rest of the data +
**Alternative 2:** Pictures are stored in the xml files, just like all the other data +
**Pros:** Follows convention +
**Cons:** Not possible for the user to access the stored data directly not using the app. Encoding and decoding needed

// end::profile[]

// tag::searching[]

=== Searching mechanism
Here, searching entails the autocomplete function, finding mechanism and suggesting mechanism.
The search mechanism is done with user's usability in mind and is fully implemented such that it is most intuitive to use for the users.

==== Autocomplete function
The autocomplete function mimics the behaviour of familiar Unix-based command lines. The autocomplete function is managed by a class `AutocompleteManager`,
whose function `attemptAutocomplete` searches for the string starting with the specified characters in the string array provided and will return the
string if a unique match is present. +

==== Finding mechanism
The find function currently matches name in the address book if those name starts with the find keyword. Whenever the a find event is triggered, the address book
will filter the address book based on the predicate provided, the mechanism of which is specified by `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class.
This class overrides the `test` function to filter the list based on `containsWordsStartWithString`, a `StringUtil` method which returns whether
a string starts with another string. For example, 'Dav' will return 'Dave' +
Looking forward, the finding mechanism will be more flexible, by implementing fuzzy search mechanism which allows returning
close matches. For example, 'Dve' will return 'Dave' or 'Dove'. +

==== Suggesting mechanism
The suggestion mechanism will be a hybrid of the above two functionalities, in which suggestion, whether commands or a match string inside the addressbook
will be shown as the user type commands. This has not been implemented but will be a UI-heavy component that anchor on the fuzzy search logic.

// end::searching[]

// tag::appoint[]

=== Appointment
Appointment is stored in a `UniqueAppointmentList`, which makes sure that the appointment is unique and does not clash with other
appointments.

image::AppointmentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Storing appointments +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Storing appointment using an in-memory UniqueAppointmentList. +
**Pro:** Does not take up space. +
**Cons:** Might be slow if there is a huge number of appointments (which is unlikely for a student) +
**Alternative 2:** Storing appointment using a separate XML file +
**Pro:** Will be faster if theres many appointments +
**Cons:** Harder to understand. Does not follow convention of other commands.

---
**Aspect:** Number of appointments +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows 1 appointment per contact. +
**Pro:** Easier to manage (add, remove, overwrite, etc.) +
**Cons:** Is limited in case user have multiple appointments with others. +
**Alternative 2:** Allows multiple appointment per contact. +
**Pro:** Catered to users with multiple appointments per contact. +
**Cons:** Would be hard to view on address book person card, hard to manage.


---
**Aspect:** Appointment reminder +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only reminds if appointment is added from another session. +
**Pro:** Does not spam user with appointments which he just added. +
**Cons:** The user might add a lot of appointments in one session which he might forget. +
**Alternative 2:** Reminds regardless of when appointment is added. +
**Pro:** Helps forgetful users. +
**Cons:** Most people will not need this.


---
**Aspect:** Appointment removal +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Appointments need to be manually removed after expiry. +
**Pro:** User has full control and will not miss out any appointments in the past. +
**Cons:** Appointment reminder still work until manually removed. +
**Alternative 2:** Appointments automatically removed after expiry. +
**Pro:** No more reminders for expired appointments. +
**Cons:** Users might forget to attend appointment, so reminder even after expiry can help.
// end::appoint[]

// tag::findtag[]

=== Find Tag

The `FindTagCommand` allows the user to locate persons in the addressbook by their tag instead of their names.

* Able to view contacts by similar attributes such as 'colleagues' or 'friends'.
* Utilises a `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` class that extends the `Predicate` class.
** Allows the `FindTag` feature to function with more than 1 keyword at a time easily.

image::FindTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Searching for tags  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Search through the `ReadOnlyPerson` class +
**Pros:** Code related to the findin through names can be reused +
**Cons:** Requires more computational power to go through all existing persons in the list. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow Tag class to store `ReadOnlyPerson` class as parameter +
**Pros:** Easier to retrieve all contacts under a certain `Tag` +
**Cons:** Potentially cleaner, but limits future improvements (combining all `Find` features).

---
**Aspect:** how `FindTag` executes (AND logic vs OR logic) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilising OR logic +
**Pros:** More flexible usag eallows user to view contacts across various tags , +
          user does not have to utilise more than 1 `FindTag` command to view various contacts. +
**Cons:** Looking for specific contacts that have more than 1 tag becomes impossible. +
**Alternative 2:** Utilising AND logic  +
**Pros:** Allows finding of specific contacts with more than 1 tag. +
**Cons:** Limits flexibility for power users that wish to view various contacts across more than 1 tag.

==== Future Improvements

* Combining all `Find` features into 1 `Filter` feature to allow filtering across all parameters of `Person` class.
* Introducing `and` and `or` commands within `Filter` to reap benefits of both AND and OR logic.

// end::findtag[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter feature implementation

The `FilterCommand` and `FilterAllCommand` serve very similar functions to the `FindCommand` and `FindTagCommand`.
However, they differ in the way that they allow more flexcibility to the user in terms of filtering contacts
because:

* All parameters are included in the seraching implementation
* Users are able to utilise OR or AND logic to make the searcha s narrow or wide as desired.
** This eliminatest the drawbacks of previous `FindCommand` and `FindTagCommand` implementations.

Sequence diagram can be inferred from `FindTagCommand` sequence diagram above.

image::FilterCommand.png[width="800"]

image::FilterAllDiagram.png[width="800"]

AS shown above, `FilterCommand` will output a list of contacts that match any of the given keywords, while `FilterAllCommand`
will output only contacts that match all keywords.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** how filter implementation is executed (AND logic vs OR logic) +
**Alternative 1 (`FilterCommand`):** Utilising OR logic +
**Pros:** More flexible usage allows user to view contacts across various parameters , +
          user does not have to utilise more than 1 command to view various contacts. +
          user is able to searcha wide array of contacts with one command
**Cons:** Looking for specific contacts by using more than one keyword is not possible. +
**Alternative 2 (`FilterAllCommand`):** Utilising AND logic  +
**Pros:** Allows finding of specific contacts with more than 1 tag. +
**Cons:** Limits flexibility for power users that wish to view various contacts across more than 1 tag.

// end::filter[]

// tag::facebook[]
=== Social Media link (Facebook)

The `BrowserPanel` java file has been enhanced to display a Facebook user search of the selected contact's name rather +
than a Google search.

* The search includes the full name of the contact.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How the Facebook webpage is loaded  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilising a Facebook user search +
**Pros:** Little chance of loading a wrong page, as the user is able to select the proper profile +
          page from a list of closest matches.
**Cons:** Will have to go throught the extra steps of locating and selecting a profile page +
**Alternative 2 :** Loading a Facebook profile page that matches the selected contact's name  +
**Pros:** Direct access to the selected contact's profile page for easy use. +
**Cons:** Extremely likely to load the wrong profile page, due to overlapping names of millions of Facebook accounts.

// end::facebook[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
