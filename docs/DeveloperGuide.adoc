== Introduction

=== About Bamboo

Bamboo is a command-line interface (CLI) based address book application directed at students.
It is a one-stop solution to help you manage your contacts in an efficient and
convenient manner. Using Bamboo, you can organize contacts into groups,
find common schedules and get connected to your contacts’ social media platforms.

=== Purpose

This document serves as the developers' guide for developing Bamboo.
It assumes that you have an intermediate level of understanding of Java.
It describes how to start developing Bamboo with the Intellij IDE,
as well as the structure of various components in the Bamboo application.

== Setting up

This section provides you with the steps required to set up everything before beginning development
on Bamboo.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure all of them pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order. To rectify this,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set both to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> to configure Intellij to check for style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Understand the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for the following:

* *At app launch*: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* *At shut down*: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The user interface of the application.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

The `UI` component, or user interface, houses all the different front-end components that you see upon running
Bamboo. It allows you to interact with Bamboo through its components, such as buttons and input boxes.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts (e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `GroupListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `MainContactPanel`, etc.). All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].
`.fxml` files should only be used to *define the basic layout or content placeholders* in the UI. *Actual content values should be instantiated by code* as much as possible.

The `.fxml` files may not immediately reflect all the UI parts that are seen in `Scene Builder`. This is because some UI parts are instantiated by code only on run-time, so opening the `.fxml` files in `Scene Builder` will not show certain parts of the UI
(e.g. the circular contact image in the contact details panel, instantiated inside `setContactImage()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ContactDetailsPanel.java[`ContactDetailsPanel.java`]).

The `UI` component does the following things:

* Uses `.fxml` and resource files (e.g. images, fonts) in `src\main\resources` that gives the application its look.

* Executes your commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can automatically update when data in the `Model` component changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the application (through event subscribers such as `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ContactDetailsPanel.java[`ContactDetailsPanel.java`]) and updates the UI accordingly.
* Animates certain parts of the application, mostly in the contact details panel.

=== Logic component

The `Logic` component houses the main logical components of the application, which processes commands
entered by users and handles them accordingly.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

The `Model` component houses all the main data of Bamboo (e.g. contact details, schedules, numbers, etc.).

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

The `Storage` component reads data from the hard disk and writes to it as well. This gives
Bamboo data persistence, so that data does not disappear upon closing Bamboo.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting
The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand`, which extends `UndoableCommand`.
It supports the sorting of persons in the address book by the `PREFIX` specified.
If the `r` flag is specified, the list of persons will be sorted in descending order.

The sorting of persons occur in `UniquePersonList`, where a call to `Collections.sort` is
made with the respective comparator and a `isReverse` boolean flag as parameters.

The sequence diagram below details the flow the execution of a `sort n/r` command.

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The execution of `sort` results in the reordering of the in-memory `UniquePersonList`.
However, the change is transient and the order of the list will return to its
original starting order as when the App initializes.

=== Finding
The finding mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand`, which extends `Command`.
It supports finding a list of specific persons by entering any substring of a person's contact field.
This includes a person's name, phone number, email, address or even their tags with `PREFIX` specified.

Finding a person is facilitated using `PartialSearchUtil`, which examines whether a base list contains any word whose
substring appears in the target list. It maps each attribute to the `find` parser and returns a list of persons
matching find condition.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `sort` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort persons through `UniquePersonList` +
**Pros:** Imputes responsibility of sorting to `UniquePersonList`, which is the class person list is declared from. +
This results in fine-grained, total control over anything to do with a person list and future implementations
will be easier and more complete. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the flow of sorting execution. +
**Alternative 2:** Perform `sort` at `ModelManager` or `AddressBook` level +
**Pros:** New developers will have an easier time tracing the sort execution flow. +
**Cons:** `ModelManager` or `AddressBook` will be highly coupled with the sort function and
any future changes to these classes may be more contrived and difficult.

---

**Aspect:** Sort Persistence +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The address book is not saved after sorting. +
**Pros:** Users may want to sort for their current session only. +
**Cons:** Sorting order is not retained when the program exits. +
**Alternative 2:** Save address book after every sort +
**Pros:** Sorting order is preserved after program exits. +
**Cons:** The original order of the address book is lost during every sort.
// end::sort[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration]).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the application.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::faveSystem[]
=== Favourite Contact System

The commands related to the Favourite system rely on the `Favourite` attribute class which is a `Person` component.

==== Add & Remove contact from Favourites (since V1.2)
**Adding a Favourite:** This feature's functions are mainly contained in the command class `AddFavouriteCommand` with its
supporting parser class `AddFavouriteCommandParser`:

* `AddFaveCommandParser`: This class is called by `AddressBookParser` and handles the parsing of the index argument and
passes the parsed index into an initialised **AddFavouriteCommand** object.

* `AddFavouriteCommand`: You may modify the command word (fadd), usage instructions and all other functions necessary for
the command to mark a `Person` as a Favourite in this class. +
The current implementation takes in the parsed index, retrieves the `Person` object of the parsed index, sets the
`Favourite` attribute to true and updates the in-memory model list of **Persons** with the updated **Person**.

**Removing a Favourite:** This feature's functions are mainly contained in the command class `RemoveFavouriteCommand` with
 its supporting parser class `RemoveFavouriteCommandParser`:

* `RemoveFaveCommandParser`: This class is called by `AddressBookParser` and handles the parsing of the index argument and
passes the parsed index into an initialised **RemoveFavouriteCommand** object.

* `RemoveFavouriteCommand`: You may modify the command word (fremove), usage instructions and all other functions necessary for
the command to unmark a `Person` as a Favourite in this class. +
The current implementation of this function works exactly like it does in `AddFavouriteCommand` except that the `Person`
retreived from the parsed index has their `Favourite` attribute updated to false.

==== Listing of only Favourite contacts (since V1.3)

**List command option:** The **list** command now has an option to list only contacts marked as favourites with
"list /f". This feature works by updating the model's `filteredList` of `Person` objects with the predicate
**isFavourite()** in `ListCommand`.

==== Other modifications to existing components to handle favourites (since V1.4)

`UniquePersonList`: The **setPerson()** function (that is called whenever a **Person** object has been modified)
also changes a `Person`'s order in the model list if their **Favourite** attribute's value has been changed.

* If the **Favourite**'s value has been changed to true, the modified **Person** is removed from the internal model list and
reinserted at the top of the list among the other favourites in lexicographical order.

* If the **Favourite**'s value has been changed to false, the modified **Person** is moved from its position among the favourites
and inserted into the position after the last favourite person in the internal model list.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storage of `Favourite` status +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new attribute class to Person, `Favourite` +
**Pros:** No need for additional overhead from maintaining a second list of Persons in model. +
**Cons:** Have to manually arrange contacts when they are added/removed from favourite status as favourite
 contacts must be at top of normal listings +
**Alternative 2:** Create and maintain a list in `model` containing favourite contacts +
**Pros:** No need to organise favourite contacts in original list, just present favourite list before normal contact list when executing `list` +
**Cons:** Tedious to manage secondary list of Persons, additional overhead when searching favourite list for specific contact
// end::faveSystem[]

// tag::profPicSystem[]
=== Profile Picture Feature
A user's profile picture is retrieved by and displayed in the UI class `MainContactPanel` with **setContactImage(Person)**.
A contact's path stored in a contact's `ProfPic` person attribute can be modified with the use of 2 commands
explained below.

==== Setting profile picture (since V1.4)
**Setting a new profile picture**: This feature's functions are mainly contained in the command class `SetPictureCommand`
with its supporting parser class `SetPictureCommandParser`:

* `SetPictureCommandParser`: This class is called by `AddressBookParser` and handles the parsing of the index argument
and provided filepath, then passes the parsed index and filepath into an initialised **SetPictureCommand** object.

* `SetPictureCommand`: You may modify the command word (ppset) and its syntax, usage instructions and all other functions necessary for
the set picture command in this class. +
The current implementation takes in the parsed index and filepath and stores them. Then,

** The given filepath is checked to see if there exists a .png or .jpg image file with **Files.probeContentType(filepath)**

** The verified .png/.jpg is then copied to the local folder **images** of the application and stored under the contact name of the
 provided index as **images\contactName.png** or **images\contactName.jpg** if the set file is a .jpg

** The **Person** provided by the index has its `ProfPic` attribute's path var modified to **contactName.png/.jpg** and
the modified **Person** saved to the in-memory model list of **Persons**

==== Resetting profile picture (since V1.4)
**Resetting a contact's profile picture** This feature's functions are mainly contained in the command class `ResetPictureCommand`
with it's supporting parser class `ResetPictureCommandParser`:

* `ResetPictureCommandParser`: This class is called by `AddressBookParser` and handles the parsing of the index argument
and passes the parsed index on to an initialised **ResetPictureCommand** object.

* `ResetPictureCommand`: You may modify the command word (ppreset), usage instructions and all other functions necessary for
the reset picture command in this class. +
The current implementation takes in the parsed index, retrieves the **Person** at that index and modifies their `ProfPic`
attribute's path var to the default "maleIcon.png before saving the modified **Person** to the in-memory model list of **Persons**
// end::profPicSystem[]

// tag::UISystem[]
=== User Interface (UI)

==== Layout of the user interface (since V1.1)

The application uses various panels such as `StackPanes` and `BorderPanes` inside `.fxml` files that define the basic layout, with no content inside of it.
Content is usually created or instantiated by code.

==== Layout of the contact details panel (since V1.2)

The main contact panel (MainContactPanel.fxml) uses a 2x2 `GridPane` to show the following:

 * Contact's image
 * Contact's details
 * Four social media icons
 * Contact's schedule

==== Layout of contact's image and social icons (since V1.2)

The (0, 0) and (1, 0) cells of the main contact panel contain nested `BorderPane` objects. These `BorderPanes` then create `Circle` objects.

These `Circle` objects are created when the `setContactImage()` and `setIcons()` methods are run. These two methods run inside `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent()` when you select a person in the person list panel.

The reason for using `BorderPane` objects is to allow centering and resizing of the `Circle` objects. Using a `Pane` will not allow positioning of objects, while using a `StackPane` will not allow resizing of objects inside of it.
A `BorderPane` supports both positioning and resizing of objects inside of it.

==== Layout of the contact's details (since V1.2)

The (1,0) cell of the main contact panel contains a `VBox` object that creates four empty `Label` objects in `setupContactDetailsBox()`.

The values of these `Label` objects are updated in `setContactDetails()` when you select a person in the person list panel.

The `setContactDetails()` method takes in a `ReadOnlyPerson` object as an argument, which holds the values of a person's contact details that are used to update the `Label` objects.

==== Animation in the contact details panel (since V1.2)

UI parts (nodes) in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ContactDetailsPanel.java[`ContactDetailsPanel.java`] are passed into a method called `easeIn` in the same file. This method takes in `Node` objects and animates them through the use of various `Transitions` objects.

`ParallelTransition` is used to play multiple `Transition` objects simultaneously. In this case, it plays `FadeTransition` and `TranslateTransition` together, resulting in what you see - text and images fading in from nothing.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the third one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies. Refer to `5.3 Troubleshooting Testing` if test failures occur.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package or test class and choose `Run 'ABC'`, where `ABC` is your desired test.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `BoundsLocatorException`.**

* Reason: The window size of the test application is too small.
* Solution: Open `src/test/java/seedu/address/TestApp.java` and find the `initPrefs` method. Find `new GuiSettings` inside the method and enlarge the window size accordingly.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
