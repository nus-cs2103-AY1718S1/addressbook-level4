== Introduction

=== Overview
This developer guide provides general information about how is this application managed explaining both architectural and coding styles.

=== Skills needed to further develop the application
The following skills and experience are useful in helping to further develop the application. +
You do not need to have an advanced understanding of the skills to get started but these are the skills you can build over time as you gain experience while working on the application.

* Knowledge of _Object Orientated Programming (OOP)_
* Basic to Intermediate programming skills (Java), and understanding of its API.
* Basic understanding of Web development skills (HTML, CSS)
* Basic understanding and knowledge of XML
* Understanding the usage of IDEs (IntelliJ)
* Understanding what is automated testing (gradle)

=== Where to find specific information

* This application uses Java 8. Full set of documentation on Java 8 is available at: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ +
* This application uses CSS for its visual appeal for the interface. For basic usage, https://www.w3schools.com/css/ is a good place to start +


== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
+

. *SceneBuilder (OPTIONAL)*  Visual tool
+
[NOTE]
Currently using Scenebuilder for Java 8. SceneBuilder 8.4.0.

=== Setting up the project

==== Setting up the project into your computer
. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

==== Setting up SceneBuilder

This application uses an external library called "controlsfx-8.40.11"

. Open Scenebuilder (You do not need to load any projects)
. Open `JAR/FXML Manager`
. Import controlsfx-8.40.11.jar (By default it will be in _C:\Users\USERPROFILE\.gradle\caches\modules-2\files-2.1\org.controlsfx\controlsfx\8.40.11\61694ec2668cc69116e970c7513aa3501179bc00_)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

=== Contribute to the project



== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Logic Command Class Diagram_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2 : Starting Stack Diagram_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3 : New Command Stack Diagram_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4 : Execute Undo Stack Diagram_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.5 : Undo Redo Sequence Diagram_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.6 : New Command Stack Diagram_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.6 : New Command Stack Diagram_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.7 : Undo Redo Activity Diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +

**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +

**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +

**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +

**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +

**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
//end::undoredo[]

//tag::opennew[]

=== `open` and `new` command mechanism

image::OpenCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Open Existing Address Book Sequence Diagram_

image::NewCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.2 : Create New Address Book Sequence Diagram_

From the sequence diagram, we can see that the workflow is very similar. One thing to note is that even though the
preprocessing is different, in the end they will post the same `SwitchAddressBookRequestEvent` to the `EventsCenter`.

image::OpenAddressBookEvent.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, when the `Open` button is clicked in the Application, it raises an event and triggers `MainApp` to update new Application metadata and restart the UI.

This loads the selected XML file which opens a new address book with contacts from selected XML file.

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Similarity of implementation for Open and New command.

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate the two commands until the final `post` event. +
**Pros:** Middle ground between Alternative 2 and Alternative 3. Merge similar actions together while separating classes
 that are doing different operations. In this case, the similar part is to finally open a new DeathNote (reset, initialize, restart...).
 Therefore, we use the same RequestEvent for both commands. The preprocessing is different, since one check for existing file and one
 check for the other way round, we separate both of them. +
**Cons:** Slightly harder for developers to get understand how `SwitchAddressBookRequestEvent` works. +
**Alternative 2:** Separate the two commands totally. +
**Pros:** Easier for new developers to understand the underlying mechanism because they can treat them as different operations. +
**Cons:** Hard to maintain. Since two commands are very similar. If a bug is found in one of them, the other one is
likely to be affected as well. Hence twice amount of work for the same outcome. +
**Alternative 3:** Combine the two commands totally. +
**Pros:** Easier to maintain because everything is within the same class. +
**Cons:** Confusing to understand. NewCommand checks that `Path` is not an existing file but OpenCommand checks that `Path`
 is an existing file. The implementation is likely to have many conditional statements. Changing one class affects both commands. +

//end::opennew[]

//tag::add[]

=== Making parameters optional

Adding a new person into DeathNote requires only `Name`. All other fields are optional. This is
achieved by allowing field objects to be instantiated with `null` parameter.

Problems arise when field objects are instantiated with a `null` parameter. Necessary changes are mostly about additional
checks of `null` in its respective class:

----
    public Phone(String phone) throws IllegalValueException {
        String trimmedPhone = phone == null ? null : phone.trim();
        if (!isValidPhone(trimmedPhone)) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_PHONE_CONSTRAINTS);
        }
        this.value = trimmedPhone;
    }
----

----
    public static boolean isValidPhone(String test) {
        return test == null || test.matches(PHONE_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----

----
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (other == this) { // short circuit if same object
            return true;
        } else if (!(other instanceof Phone)) { // instanceof handle nulls
            return false;
        } else if (this.value == ((Phone) other).value) {
            return true;
        } else if (this.value != null && this.value.equals(((Phone) other).value)) { // state check
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
----

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Which component is responsible for `null`. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Parameters can be instantiated with `null` parameter, but the object itself cannot be `null`.
**Pros:** Only parameter classes that are within `Model` component need to be modified. Other components are still functioning
correctly. This improves coherent within `Model` component. +
**Cons:** Potentially confusing for new developers. This design is equivalent to "having a phone with `null` number" rather
than the more intuitive "doesn't have a phone".

**Alternative 2:** Parameter objects can be `null`. +
**Pros:** More intuitive for a new developer. Easier modification on `Model` component.
**Cons:** Many components rely on the assumption that parameter objects are non-null. Hence, this design will fail the other components.
More verification is needed outside the `Model` component when interacting with these parameter objects. This increases coupling. +

//tag::parameter[]

=== Adding new parameters to person

The general Steps to take are as follows: +

. Create your new Parameter in a unique java file (e.g. Birthday.java) +
. Add your parameter in the the person model +
. Add code to "teach" the application how to parse your parameter.Be sure to include examples +
. Ensure that your parameter can be save +
. Create test to ensure that there are no corner cases that can cause crashes or bugs

Adding a new parameter to a person requires updates in multiple files as well as the inclusion
of new tests. The existing files that need to be modified are as follows: +

*Main:*

. Userguide.adoc (for usage instructions)
.<yournewparameter>.java (Creation of your new parameter)
. CliSyntax.java (add the prefix your would like your parameter to use here)
. ParserUtil.java (Teach the application how to interprete your new parameter)
. AddCommand.java (if there is a need for the new parameter to be used upon adding a new person)
. AddCommandParser.java (Ensure your parameter is present in the parser)
. EditCommand.java (if the parameter can be editted)
. EditCommandParser.java (ensure your parameter is present in the parser)
. RemarkCommand.java (ensure your parameter is compatible with the Remark command)
. Person.java (add your parameter to the model)
. ReadOnlyPerson.java (add instructions on how to read your parameter from saved file)
. XMLAdaptedPerson.java (Ensure the XML file the application keeps data in can recognise your parameter)
. SampleData.util (modify this if you want to have initial sample data shown upon load)
. PersonCard.java (Modify this so that your parameter will be displayed in the GUI if needed)
. PersonCardHandle.java (Teaches the program how to read off the xml file and what to do)
. PersonListCard.fxml (Modify this so that your parameter will be displayed in the GUI if needed)

*Tests:*

. <yourparametername>test.java (To check if your parameter accepts illegal values)
. CommandTestUtil.java (Add your parameter to the test case builder)
. PersonBuilder.java (Add your parameter to the test person model)
. PersonUtil.java (Add your Parameter to this test)
. TypicalPersons.java (Sample test people)
. PersonCardTest.java (Add your Parameter to this test)
. GuiTestAssert.java (Add your Parameter to this test)
. EditCommandSystemTest.java (Add new tests to check for odd behaviour)
. EditPersonDescriptorTest.java (Add your parameter to this test)
. EditPersonDescriptorBuilder.java (Add your Parameter to this test)
. AddCommandSystemTest.java (Add new tests to check for odd behaviour)
. AddCommandParserTest (Add your Parameter to this test)

You may need to create a new java file in logic/commands if your parameter requires a command to use (e.g. remarks.java) +

Please refer to the following links to get an idea on how to add a new parameter: +
https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W10-B3/main/pull/16/files[Adding website parameter] +
https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W10-B3/main/pull/8/files[Adding birthday parameter]

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of a new variable. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add the variable into person and make it be able to be initialised at the constructor with all other existing variables. +
**Pros:** Consistent with code and how the commands work. +
**Cons:** Requires a lot of work as many classes depend on using the `Person` constructor; mostly tests. +

**Alternative 2:** Adding the variable into person but not initialising it at `Person` constructor. +
**Pros:** Implementation is much easier and it does not affect tests in any way. +
**Cons:** It is not consistent with the variables in `Person` +

Browser is reloaded with the `Person` ' s website if the `Person` selected has a website. If not we google search the
`Person` 's name.

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of profile picture +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy image file into data folder and use the image from there +
**Pros:** Application and data folder can be transferred to different computers and still work +
**Cons:** May have to take note of size of files added into folder as transferring the data folder may take
time if the file is too big+

**Alternative 2:** Saving the path of the image +
**Pros:** No extra work in resizing or copying the file +
**Cons:** Application and data folder cannot be transferred to different computers and be expected to work +

//end::website[]

//tag::profilepicture[]

=== Profile Picture

The picture variable in `Person` is a normal variable in `Person` which only stores strings with ".png" suffix. +
The data that we save in our xml file will be "pictureName.png" plus the picture of the person in our data folder in
.png format. +

image::PersonClassDiagram.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.6.1 : Person Class Diagram_

The `Picture` class checks for existence of the file using `File` class. +

[source, java]
----
public static boolean isValidPicture(String fileLocation) {
...
    File file = new File(fileLocation);
    if (file.exists() && (fileLocation.endsWith(PICTURE_SUFFIX))) {
        return true;
    } else {
        file = new File(PICTURE_SAVE_LOCATION + fileLocation);
        if (file.exists()) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
----

Once the existence of the file is checked, we check the size of the file so that we do not save very large files
as we do not want our data file to be too large. +
We resize the files if they are too large by shrinking it into a shorter width and height. +
We also rename the file with a unique ID so that picture names will not collide and be overwritten.

[source, java]
----
public Picture(String fileLocation) {
...
    String newFileName = UUID.randomUUID().toString() + PICTURE_SUFFIX;

    File src = new File(trimmedFileLocation);
    File dest = new File(PICTURE_SAVE_LOCATION + newFileName);

    // If file is too big, resize it.
    if (src.length() > PICTURE_MAX_SIZE) {
        resizeAndSaveImage(src, newFileName);
    } else {
        copyImage(src, dest);
    }
    this.value = newFileName;
...
}
----

After resizing the file or that if the file does not exceed our limit, we save/copy the file into our data folder
so that we can reuse it next time if we move the application around. +

[source, java]
----
public static void resizeAndSaveImage(File file, String newFileName) throws IllegalValueException {
    try {
        BufferedImage resizedImage = resizeImage(ImageIO.read(file));

        // Saving of image into data folder
        ImageIO.write(resizedImage, "png", new File(PICTURE_SAVE_LOCATION + newFileName));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_PROFILEPICTURE_ERROR);
    }
}
----

[source, java]
----
public static void copyImage(File src, File dest) throws IllegalValueException {
    try {
        FileUtils.copyFile(src, dest);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_PROFILEPICTURE_ERROR);
    }
}
----

To show the picture in the application, `PersonCard` is updated and we clip the picture with a circle so it looks nice.

[source, java]
----
private void initPicture(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    picture.setImage(new Image(person.getPicture().getPictureLocation()));

    Circle circle = new Circle(32.0, 32.0, 30.0);
    picture.setClip(circle);
}
----

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of profile picture +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy image file into data folder and use the image from there +
**Pros:** Application and data folder can be transferred to different computers and still work +
**Cons:** May have to take note of size of files added into folder as transferring the data folder may take
time if the file is too big+

**Alternative 2:** Saving the path of the image +
**Pros:** No extra work in resizing or copying the file +
**Cons:** Application and data folder cannot be transferred to different computers and be expected to work +

//end::profilepicture[]

//tag::theme[]

=== Theme mechanism

Theme mechanism uses a singleton class called `UiStyle` which stores the scene of the application in it. +
This allows the modification of the scene's css at runtime.

The class `UiStyle` requires the scene to be set at `MainWindow` class for it to be used to edit themes.

[source,java]
----
public class UiStyle {
...
    private static Scene scene = null;

     public static void setScene(Scene s) {
        scene = s;
        setToDarkTheme(); // Default theme
    }

    public static void setToLightTheme() {
        scene.getStylesheets().remove(DARK_THEME_STYLE);
        scene.getStylesheets().add(LIGHT_THEME_STYLE);
    }

    public static void setToDarkTheme() {
        scene.getStylesheets().remove(LIGHT_THEME_STYLE);
        scene.getStylesheets().add(DARK_THEME_STYLE);
    }
}
----

Example of calling the application to change to light theme:

----
UiStyle.getInstance().setToLightTheme();
----

image::ThemeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.1 : Theme Sequence Diagram_

Although this function can be called anywhere, it should only be called when `ThemeCommand` is issued.

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of theme +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pass the scene of the application into a singleton class dedicated for UI usage only +
**Pros:** Changing the theme can be called easily +
**Cons:** Changing of the theme can be called anywhere by any class +

**Alternative 2:** Passing the scene down from `MainApp` class to `ThemeCommand` class +
**Pros:** Only `ThemeCommand` class will be able to modify the theme +
**Cons:** Very tedious as `ThemeCommand` class is very far down the architecture +

//end::theme[]
//tag::tagcolor[]

=== Tag colors

The colors for tags are randomed upon start up of the application.
Tags has been modified to use hexadecimal colors instead of having an array of colors
(e.g. red,blue,green) and selecting from the array of colors. +
This increases the number of colors we can have for tags tremendously. +

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of color for tags +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have tags to be colored using hex instead of defined words +
**Pros:** The number of colors for tags are limited to the number of hex values there are +
**Cons:** Colors are decided by random, the color differences may not be different. (e.g #FFFFFF, #FFFFFE) +

**Alternative 2:** Have tag colors to be in an array and randomly choose from them +
**Pros:** Colors of tags are defined and the difference between any two colors can be seen easily +
**Cons:** Limited number of colors codes +

//end::tagcolor[]
//tag::sortlist[]

=== Sorted list

The list is sorted by names automatically when shown by using java's list.sort.

[source, java]
----
public ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> getFilteredPersonList() {
    return FXCollections.unmodifiableObservableList(filteredPersons.sorted());
}
----

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Sorting list of contacts +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Return a sorted list when display needs to update +
**Pros:** Very easy to implement, +
**Cons:** Only can sort by name +

**Alternative 2:** Have a sort command to sort contacts +
**Pros:** Contacts can be sorted according to different variables +
**Cons:** New command has to be added. +

//end::sortlist[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

We highly recommend using Gradle in _headless_ mode with the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library such that
GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the computer while the tests
are running in the background.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the following command

  Windows  :   gradlew clean headless allTests
  Mac/Linux: ./gradlew clean headless allTests

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

We provide two alternative methods, but these might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific
idiosyncrasies.

*Alternative Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run`

*Alternative Method 2: Using Gradle (non-headless)*

Open a console and run the following command

  Windows  :   gradlew clean allTests
  Mac/Linux: ./gradlew clean allTests

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
