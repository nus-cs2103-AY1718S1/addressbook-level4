== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* link:#security-component[*`Security`*] : Secures the address book.

Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the address book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in xml format and read it back.

// tag::lock[]
=== Security component

image::SecurityClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.6.1 : Structure of the Security Component_
// end::lock[]
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/security/Security.java[`Security.java`]
// tag::lock[]
The `Security` component,

* can encrypt address book and decrypt by a given password.
* can prevent user from executing commands if address book is secured.
// end::lock[]

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism

The find command is a little bit different from other commands like `AddCommand`. It can specify options in in its arguments. There are three steps for parsing commands with options, which are as follows:

. `LogicManager` passes user input into `AddressBookParser` which distinguishes command word and arguments from user input.
. `AddressBookParser` creates `FindCommandParser`. `FindCommandParser` uses `CommandOptionUtil` for getting option prefix and option argument.
. `FindCommandParser` instantiates different kinds of `CommandOption` in its body according to the option prefix. Different `CommandOption` objects create different `FindCommand`.

`CommandOption` is an abstract class representing an optional behavior. It is implemented in this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FindOptionByName extends CommandOption<FindCommand> {

    public FindOptionByName(String optionArgs) {
        super(optionArgs);
    }

    @Override
    public FindCommand parse() throws ParseException {
        // ... parse optionArgs and creat FindCommand
    }

    @Override
    boolean isValidOptionArgs() {
        // ... check the validity of input arguments
    }
}
----

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Implementation of Command Options +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend abstract class `CommandOption`. +
**Pros:** It is easier to understand the architecture of parsing chain. +
**Cons:** Using inheritance makes it more troublesome than implementing directly. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve inheritance. Only needs to change one file.
**Cons:** This structure is not clear.

---
// end::find[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The user can also choose to undo multiple commands at the same time. Sequence of commands to be undone for `undo 5` is the same as typing `undo` 5 times.

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed). Similar to `undo`, user can also choose to redo multiple undo commands at the same time (`redo 5`).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The sort mechanism makes use of sort() method in Java 8, which takes in Comparator as parameter. It is written in Lambda expression which makes the code more concise.

The advantage of Lambda expression can be illustrated by the following two code examples.

Example of codes written in pre Java 8 fashion:
[source,java]
----
Collection.sort(fruitList, new Comparator<Fruit>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(Fruit a, Fruit b) {
        return a.getSize().compareTo(b.getSize());
    }
});
----

With Lambda expression:
[source,java]
----
Collection.sort(fruitList, (Fruit a, Fruit b) -> a.getSize().compareTo(b.getSize()));
----

Both examples sort the fruits in the fruitList according to their size, where smallest on top and largest at the bottom. The amount of verbosity has been reduced by using the Lambda expression. In fact, it can be more concise by removing the variable type from the parameters as the type information is inferred from the context in which the Lambda expression is being used (adopted by sort command):
[source,java]
----
Collection.sort(fruitList, (a, b) -> a.getSize().compareTo(b.getSize()));
----

[NOTE]
Lambda expression is equivalent to overriding the 'compare(T o1, T o2)' method in 'Comparator' class.

Sort command takes in command `OPTIONS` to perform sorting by five fields of a person: by name, by phone number, by email, by address and by tag. It determines the user input `OPTION` by string comparision instead of utilising option parser as command options used in `find` command are mode enabling options that enable different modes of finding mechanism.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of 'SortCommand' 'OPTION' +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make use of `CommandOptionUtil` +
**Pros:** Standardised usage of command options format which can be implemented into other commands. +
**Cons:** Need to extend abstract class 'CommandOption' if a more complex parsing procedure is involved. e.g. 'find' command. +
**Alternative 2:** Declare new 'OPTION' format +
**Pros:** No inheritance required, minimise error. +
**Cons:** 'SortCommand' class specific, cannot be reused by other commands.

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of sort +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Lambda expression +
**Pros:** Short and concise. +
**Cons:** Increase bug occurrence as variable type can be omitted. +
**Alternative 2:** Pre Java 8 practice +
**Pros:** Widely practised, minimise error. +
**Cons:** Long and unclear, need to manually override 'compare' method.
// end::sort[]

// tag::lock[]
=== Lock/Unlock mechanism

The lock/unlock mechanism is based on `SecurityManager`. When lock/unlock command is executed, it gets an singleton instance from `SecurityManager` and calls its security methods. +

Some important methods in `SecurityManager` are as follows:
[source,java]
----
public interface Security extends SecureStorage {

    void raise(BaseEvent event);

    boolean isPermittedCommand(String commandWord);

    // ... other methods
}

public interface SecureStorage {

    boolean isEncrypted() throws IOException;

    void encryptAddressBook(String password)
            throws IOException, EncryptOrDecryptException;

    void decryptAddressBook(String password)
            throws IOException, EncryptOrDecryptException;
}

public class SecurityManager extends ComponentManager implements Security {
    // ... implementations
}

----

When methods in interface `SecureStorage` are called, `SecurityManager` will not realize them by itself. Instead, it calls the methods in `Storage` which also implements `SecureStorage`, because component `Secure` should not read and save files. +

The "raise" method is used to communicate with the `UI` component while "isPermittedCommand" is called in `Logic` component to check whether a certain command have enough permission to be executed. The `Security` component acts like a bridge. It fulfills its function by communicating with every component. +

After executing lock and unlock command, they will send `ReloadAddressBookEvent` to `MainApp` to clear all history and undo/redo stacks and then reload the address book from storage.

image::LockSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::lock[]

// tag::favourite[]
=== Favourite mechanism

The favourite mechanism is very similar to the one used in edit command. The feature follows the sequence of steps:

. `AddressBookParser` calls upon `FavouriteCommandParser`, which parses the argument as an index and creates a FavouriteCommand object.
. The person identified by the index (personToFavourite) in `AddressBook` is replaced with a new person (favouritedPerson) that has its `favourite` instance inverted to either `true` or `false`.
. The `favouritePerson` method in AddressBook then creates two `UniquePersonList` to implement the sorting. Persons with `favourite` = `true` will be sorted into the `favouriteList`. Persons with `favourite` = `false` will be sorted into the `notFavouriteList`.
. The two lists will then be merged into the `persons` list in `AddressBook`, with `favouriteList` being at the top.

The following diagram illustrates the sequence described above:

image::FavouriteCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The code below shows how FavouriteCommand is implemented:

[source,java]
----
public class FavouriteCommand extends UndoableCommand {

    public FavouriteCommand(Index index) {
        requireNonNull(index);
       this.index = index;
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyPerson personToFavourite = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());

        Person favouritedPerson = createFavouritedPerson(personToFavourite);

        try {
            model.favouritePerson(personToFavourite, favouritedPerson);
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException dpe) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target person cannot be missing");
        }
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);

        if (!favouritedPerson.getFavourite()) {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_UNFAVOURITE_PERSON_SUCCESS, favouritedPerson));
        } else {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_FAVOURITE_PERSON_SUCCESS, favouritedPerson));
        }
    }

    @Override
    private static Person createFavouritePerson(ReadOnlyPerson personToFavourite) {
        assert personToFavourite != null;

        Name originalName = personToFavourite.getName();
        Phone originalPhone = personToFavourite.getPhone();
        Email originalEmail = personToFavourite.getEmail();
        Address originalAddress = personToFavourite.getAddress();
        Set<Tag> originalTags = personToFavourite.getTags();
        List<TodoItem> originalTodoItems = personToFavourite.getTodoItems();
        boolean newFavourite = !personToFavourite.getFavourite();

        return new Person(originalName, originalPhone, originalEmail, originalAddress,
                originalTags, originalTodoItems, newFavourite);
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Sorting of contact list with favourites +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Favourited contacts are sorted separately. +
**Pros:** Favourite contact remains at the top of the list. +
**Cons:** Does not preserve the original order of the favourite contacts list. +
**Alternative 2:** All contacts sorted in order +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Favourite contacts are no longer at the top of the list after sorting. +
**Alternative 3:** Favourite contacts are not included in sorting +
**Pros:** Preserves original order of favourites. Favourite contacts remain at the top of the list. +
**Cons:** User may want to sort favourites if list is large. +

---

**Aspect:** Unfavouriting contacts in a sorted list +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Contact removed from favourites is pushed to bottom of favourite list. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Does not follow the order of the sorting. User have to re-enter desired sort command after unfavouriting to get the correct order. +
**Alternative 2:** Unfavourited contact automatically sorted according to last used sort command +
**Pros:** Automatically sorts the list without having to type another command. +
**Cons:** User may not want the unfavourited contact to be sorted. +
// end::favourite[]

// tag::tdo[]
=== Todo mechanism

Todo mechanism uses `CommandOptionUtil` to parse its options. The model class for each todo item is `TodoItem`, which has three fields including start, end, task to describe an item. +

According to the option, todo command sends different events to `UI`.  Todo mechanism sends `JumpToListRequestEvent` to both `PersonListPanel` and `TodoPanel` to select one person and load his/her todo list. Meanwhile todo mechanism uses `ClearListSelectionEvent` to clear the selection in `PersonListPanel` and `ShowAllTodoItemsEvent` to show all todo items of all contacts.
When todo command need to add or delete some items, todo mechanism will call methods in `Model` to add, delete, list and access to storage.

Codes below show how to parse base on options.
[source,java]
----
// returns TodoCommand by parsing {@code optionPrefix}
        switch (optionPrefix) {
        case TodoCommand.PREFIX_TODO_ADD:
            return new TodoOptionAdd(optionArgs, index).parse();

        default:
            throw new ParseException(PARSE_EXCEPTION_MESSAGE);
        }
----

// end::tdo[]

// tag::switch[]
=== Switch mechanism

Switch mechanism just sends the `SwitchDisplayEvent` to `MainWindow`. It will change the child in `switchablePlaceholder` according to the user input.

The code below shows how switching is done:

[source,java]
----
private void switchPlaceholderDisplay(int mode) {
        switchablePlaceholder.getChildren().clear();
        switch (mode) {
        case SwitchCommand.SWITCH_TO_TODOLIST:
            switchablePlaceholder.getChildren().add(todoPanel.getRoot());
            break;
        case SwitchCommand.SWITCH_TO_BROWSER:
            switchablePlaceholder.getChildren().add(browserPanel.getRoot());
            break;
        default:
            // Only two modes, no default option here.
            break;
        }
    }
----

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Handle different mode +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one command followed by mode string +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Hard to remember. +
**Alternative 2:** Use two commands +
**Pros:** East to use and remember. +
**Cons:** More complicated to implement. Become hard to extend if there are more than two modes.

// end::switch[]

// tag::select[]
=== Select mechanism

Select command also has options. After parsed by `AddressBookParser` and `CommandOptionUtil`, select mechanism sends `ChangeSearchEvent` to `BrowserPanel` in order to change search url. Then, it sends `JumpToListRequestEvent` to change selection in `PersonListPanel` and `PersonListPanel` will send `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` to `BrowserPanel` to indicate which person is selected.
// end::select[]

// tag::deletebyname[]
=== Delete by name mechanism

It is an undoable delete command that offers an alternative to the existing `delete` command.

It takes in the user input name and compare it with all persons' name field. Similar to `find` by name, the user input name has to be the entire first/last/full name of the persons stored in the address book. Multiple contacts can be shortlisted by separating names by spaces.

As the command will always call the entire list before execution, there is no need to modify list for the command to be executed.

The code below shows how this command handles different input situations:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate);
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> predicateList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

    if (predicateList.size() > 1) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_MULTIPLE_PERSON_FOUND);
    } else if (predicateList.size() == 0) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_PERSON_NAME_ABSENT);
    } else {
        ReadOnlyPerson personToDelete = predicateList.get(0);

        try {
            model.deletePerson(personToDelete);
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            assert false : MESSAGE_PERSON_NAME_ABSENT;
        }

        model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_PERSON_SUCCESS, personToDelete));
    }
}
----

After parsing a valid user input name(s), the command will get a `filteredPersonList` using the parsed input:

* The contact is deleted immediately if there is only one result found.
* A updated list will be shown with multiple persons found.
* A warning message will be shown if no match can be found with the specified name.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Parsing of user inputs +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Convert the `String` user input into a `Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson>` object. +
**Pros:** Able to shortlist contacts with multiple names. +
**Cons:** Reject inputs that do not match the entire first/last/full name. +
**Alternative 2:** Utilise the given `String` user inputs +
**Pros:** Do not need to parse inputs before comparision. +
**Cons:** Able to delete contacts with a single letter or contacts with short name can not be deleted (set a minimum comparision `String` length, e.g. the input has to be at least 3 characters long).
// end::deletebyname[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export mechanism

It first creates a `File` object with the user specified file path.

The command then returns the current address book as a `ReadOnlyAddressBook` object and then serialize it using `XmlSerializableAddressBook` class constructor.

Saving of data is achieved with `XmlFileStorage#saveDataToFile` method which saves the above mentioned serialized address book into the newly created file.

Code fragments to show above mentioned export mechanism:
[source,java]
----
ReadOnlyAddressBook localAddressBook = model.getAddressBook();

File file = new File(userPrefsFilePath);

try {
    FileUtil.createIfMissing(file);
} catch (IOException e) {
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_STORAGE_ERROR);
}

try {
    XmlFileStorage.saveDataToFile(file, new XmlSerializableAddressBook(localAddressBook));
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_STORAGE_ERROR);
}
----
// end::export[]

// tag::add[]
=== Enhance Add command

The add command is enhanced to allow user to leave certain fields empty (phone, address and email). Mechanism of the command is exactly the same as before, with the addition of a `initialiseEmptyFields` method in `AddCommandParser`. The `initialiseEmptyFields` method appends the prefix of each empty field followed by a '-' instead of throwing a `ParseException` if the fields are empty. Appending an empty field is done using the String.concat() method in the java.lang.String package. The method then returns a new string with the empty fields.

The code below shows how the `initialiseEmptyFields` method is implemented:

[source,java]
----
private static String initialiseEmptyFields(String args) {
    if (!args.contains("a/")) {
        args = args.concat(" a/ -");
    }
    if (!args.contains("e/")) {
        args = args.concat(" e/ -");
    }
    if (!args.contains("p/")) {
        args = args.concat(" p/ -");
    }
    return args;
}
----
// end::add[]

// tag::unredo[]
=== Enhance Undo/Redo command

The new `undo` and `redo` commands allows the user to specify how many commands to undo or redo (eg. `undo 5`, `redo 5`).
The sequence of commands to be undone for `undo 5` is the same as executing `undo` 5 times (refer to Section 3.2) . Similarly for `redo`, the number specified simply runs the `redo` command the same number of times. If no index is specified, the `undo` or `redo` command will only execute 1 time. `UndoCommandParser` and `RedoCommandParser` have been added in order to take in the index and `AddressBookParser` now calls upon `UndoCommandParser` and `RedoCommandParser` first instead of `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` directly.

The code below shows how the RedoCommandParser differentiate the index:

[source,java]
----
public RedoCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    if (!args.isEmpty()) {
        try {
            Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
            return new RedoCommand(index);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(
                String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, RedoCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    } else {
        return new RedoCommand();
    }
}
----
[NOTE]
The UndoCommandParser uses the same code. The only difference is that it returns an UndoCommand object instead.
// end::unredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, AcquaiNote depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
