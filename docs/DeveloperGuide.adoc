By: `Team F10-B4`      Since: `Aug 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

---

// tag::finds[]
=== Find person(s) using different details

The `finds` command is an improved version from `find` command. It allows user to search using other details such as phone number, email or tag instead of just name.

The user can use this command with only ONE of the following prefixes

* `n/` : To search by name(s)
* `p/` : To search by phone number(s)
* `e/` : To search by email(s)
* `t/` : To search by tag(s)

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation work:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The `predicate` used depends on which type of detail the user is using to find.

The 4 predicates are as follow:

* if search by `name` then `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` is used
* if search by `phone number` then `PhoneContainsSpecifiedKeywordsPredicate` is used
* if search by `email` then `EmailContainsSpecifiedKeywordsPredicate` is used
* if search by `tag` then `TagContainsSpecifiedKeywordsPredicate` is used

==== Design Considerations

It is implemented to search with one type of detail only so that the returned results will be relevant to that type of detail used only. i.e. if a user search for a person with phone number then only the phone numbers of the returned contacts are relevant, and other details are irrelevant to the input phone number during the search.

Alternative considered is to allow user input multiple details in each search. It may help to narrow down and shorten the list of contacts that will be returned, but it is not useful as user may only recall some details of a person only. For example:

*Scenario one*

* `Contact 1` : Name `John Tan` and phone number `12345678`
* `Contact 2` : Name `John Doe` and phone number `12349875`
* `Contact 3` : Name `Amy Chan` and phone number `98765432`
* User wants to find `John Tan` but do not recall surname and key in `John` only
* User cannot recall the number and key in a random number `43567823`
* There will be no results returned in this scenario as input phone number does not match the phone numbers in `Contact 1` and `Contact 2` that contains `John`

*Scenario two*

* `Contact 1` : Name `John Tan` and phone number `12345678`
* User wants to find `John Tan` and key in `John Tan`
* User cannot recall the number and key in a random number `43567823`
* There will be no results returned in this scenario as input phone number does not match the phone number in the `Contact 1` although the name matches exactly.

From the two scenarios, we know that unless the user knows the exact details (i.e. full name, exact phone number, exact email and etc) otherwise `finds` command with multiple details input is practically not useful as no results will be returned.

**Aspect:** Finding person with other details. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Able to search with other details but only one type of detail for each search +
**Pros:** Easier to be implemented when only one type of detail is used. +
**Cons:** Repeating functions for different details. +
**Alternative 2:** Able to find with multiple details. +
**Pros:** Lesser repeated functions is possible. +
**Cons:** Harder to implement and increased complexity may affect efficiency.

---
// end::finds[]

// tag::important[]
=== Important tag

Any person that has `important` tag will be filtered and then insert to the top of the list. +

It is implemented to check whether any person in addressbook has `important` tag each time `add` or `list` command is executed

[source,java]
----
@Override
    public void filterImportantTag() throws PersonNotFoundException, DuplicatePersonException {
        ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson> notImportantPersons = new ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson>();
        ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson> importantPersons = new ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson>();

        for (int i = 0; i < addressBook.getPersonList().size(); i++) {
            // ...Check through and filter all persons in addressbook with important tag to importantPersons list...
        }

        /**
         * If any tags in addressbook contains the {@code keyword}
         * then proceed to insert the contact(s) in {@code importantPersons} to the top of the addressbook
         */

        if (importantPersons.size() != 0) {
            // ...Perform logic to insert persons with important tag to the top...
        }
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Perform insertion of persons with important tag to the top quickly. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter person with `important` tag to a list and those without to another list then merge the lists together. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and works well when there are not a lot of persons. +
**Cons:** Time complexity is O(n2) hence slows down as more persons are being added over time. +
**Alternative 2:** Create additional addressbook that stores only important contacts and execute merge only when a new person is added to the addressbook. +
**Pros:** Able to achieve O(n) time complexity. +
**Cons:** Additional addressbook is redundant and takes up memory space.

---
// end::important[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorted persons

Persons stored in the addressbook will be sorted in ascending alphabetical order based on their name.

Persons in the addressbook will be sorted each time the user execute `add` or `list` command.

Sorting is achieved by using java Collection.sort() method with a specified NameComparator.

[source,java]
----
public class NameComparator implements Comparator <ReadOnlyPerson> {

    @Override
    public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson p1, ReadOnlyPerson p2) {
        return p1.getName().fullName.compareToIgnoreCase(p2.getName().fullName);
    }
}
----

The NameComparator compares two names and ignore their case.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add and sort operations work together:

image::AddSortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Executing `list` command calls sortAllPersons() and filterImportantTag().

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Sort the persons in the list fast. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use java Collection.sort() which is a merge sort algorithm. +
**Pros:** Works well with few persons in the addressbook and merge sort algorithm is stable. +
**Cons:** Time complexity is nlog(n) hence sorting time increases as more people are being added over time. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement insertion sort algorithm. +
**Pros:** Able to achieve O(n) time complexity which is the fastest. +
**Cons:** Addressbook has to be almost sorted to achieved O(n) time complexity, otherwise can result in O(n2).

---
// end::sort[]

// tag::add[]
=== Quick add

Only name and phone number are the required fields. +

Program will handle and create default objects for all other fields that are not fulfilled by user. +

The function below is the code to create objects with default values when empty field exists.

[source, java]
----
 public static Optional <String> getDetails(Optional <String> value, Prefix prefix) throws ParseException {
        if (!value.isPresent()) {
            if (prefix.equals(PREFIX_BIRTHDAY)) {
                return value.ofNullable("00/00/0000");
            } else if (prefix.equals(PREFIX_EMAIL)) {
                return value.ofNullable("No email");
            } else if (prefix.equals(PREFIX_ADDRESS)) {
                return value.ofNullable("No address");
            } else if (prefix.equals(PREFIX_REMARK)) {
                return value.ofNullable("No remark");
            }
        }

        return value;
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Allow empty fields for `add` command. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create objects for empty fields with default values. +
**Pros:** Allow user to add a person even without full details. +
**Cons:** Nil.

---
// end::add[]

// tag::colortag[]
=== Persisting colored tags

Enhanced feature to allow unique colored tags to persist after the program exits without having to save color data on external files.

Full Code:
[source,java]
----
private static String getColorForTag(String tagValue) {

        if (!tagColors.containsKey(tagValue)) {
            int multiplier = 1;
            int asciiSum = (tagValue.hashCode() > 1) ? tagValue.hashCode() : tagValue.hashCode() * -1;

            int colorRed = asciiSum % 256;
            int colorGreen = (asciiSum / 2) % 256;
            int colorBlue = (asciiSum / 3) % 256;
            while ((colorRed + colorGreen + colorBlue) > 700) {
                asciiSum = (asciiSum / multiplier) * ++multiplier;
                colorRed = asciiSum % 256;
                colorGreen = (asciiSum / 2) % 256;
                colorBlue = (asciiSum / 3) % 256;
            }
            String colorString = String.format("#%02x%02x%02x", colorRed, colorGreen, colorBlue);
            tagColors.put(tagValue, colorString);
        }

        return tagColors.get(tagValue);
    }
----

Java's `hashcode()` method from *String* library will be used to obtain a unique 32-bit integer hash value of the tag String. We first obtain the hashcode and ensure it is a positive value.
Function *getColorForTag(String tagValue)* is supposedly implemented in the PersonCard class, as expected from suggestions on developer guide UI component.
(Note: Identical strings will result in the same hashcode value)

[source,java]
----
int asciiSum = (tagValue.hashCode() > 1) ? tagValue.hashCode() : tagValue.hashCode() * -1;
----

We then do a separate division of each color and modulus it by *256* to ensure that it will stay within the RGB limit of 0 - 255.

[source,java]
----
int colorRed = asciiSum % 256;
int colorGreen = (asciiSum / 2) % 256;
int colorBlue = (asciiSum / 3) % 256;
----

To ensure that colors stays within visible range, we do a check if sum of RGB is above 700. If it is, it is likely that the color generated is too bright and would not be visible with the white font, hence regenerate the color again.
We can use an incremental multiplier to regenerate another unique hashcode from the original hashcode. However, to prevent the numbers form getting exponentially large and exceeding the 32-bit sized integer, we shall first divide it by the previous multiplier.
It is save to assume that chances of collision with other hashcodes is extremely low since we are using extremely large numbers.

[source,java]
----
while ((colorRed + colorGreen + colorBlue) > 700) {
                asciiSum = (asciiSum / multiplier) * ++multiplier;
                colorRed = asciiSum % 256;
                colorGreen = (asciiSum / 2) % 256;
                colorBlue = (asciiSum / 3) % 256;
}
----

Finally, we format the RBG values into hexadecimal format with a hex symbol in front to conform with conventional CSS color styling before adding it into the color tag.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Generating of colors for `colorTag`. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate unique color based on tag string. +
**Pros:** Unique tags will always have unique colors. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the color code generation. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a static list of limited colors and randomly retrieve colors from there. +
**Pros:** Does not involve complex code generation, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Tag colors renew whenever program restarts.

---

**Aspect:** Saving colors retain color persistence after program shuts down. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Morph in-built `hashcode()` function output to obtain RBG colors. +
**Pros:** Color persistence without the need to save color details onto offline files. +
**Cons:** Chances of certain tags resulting in generating very similar RGB colors. +
**Alternative 2:** Save chosen tag colors onto external file. +
**Pros:** Hard for new developers to understand how colors are retained. +
**Cons:** Must create additional file and include additional unnecessary codes for read/write.

// end::colortag[]

// tag::gmap[]
=== Google Map Mechanism

The Google map mechanism resides in a `GmapCommand` which also inherits from the `Command` object.

image::GmapClassDiagram.png[width:100]
_Figure 3.9.0.1 : GmapCommand object class diagram_

There are two ways the user can utilize the Google map feature, first by entering the command into CommandBox or selecting the **Google Map** option from the dropdown menu on each `PersonCard` panel.

==== Method 1

The `GmapCommand` object sequence diagram can be seen below:

image::GmapSequenceDiagram1.png[width="750"]
_Figure 3.9.1.1 : GmapCommand parser sequence diagram_

As we can see, `GmapCommand` object is created after input has been validated from the `AddressBookParser`.
After initialization, `GmapCommand` will post a `DisplayGmapEvent` event while returning a command success or command failed message in *result* and return it to the LogicManager for GUI display.
The `DisplayGmapEvent` object contains information regarding the index of person in the addressbook.
Address data of a person can then be retrieved later using this index.

image::GmapSequenceDiagram2.png[width="750"]
_Figure 3.9.1.2 : GmapCommand execution sequence diagram_


Event handling of `DisplayGmapEvent` is done on the `BrowserPanel` that subsequently loads its **loadMapPage()** function.

`GmapCommand` object has double constructor that takes in either index-based or a predicate containing names to be searched.

[source,java]
----
public GmapCommand(Index targetIndex) {
        this.usingIndex = true;
        this.targetIndex = targetIndex;
    }

public GmapCommand(NameConsistsKeywordsPredicate predicate) {
    this.usingIndex = false;
    this.predicate = predicate;
}
----

Command execution residing in **execute()** will then attempt to validate the given index if it exists or returning the first index of a list of persons that matches all the predicate that the user has indicated.

Finally, **DisplayGmapEvent** will be raised with this index in its parameter.

[source,java]
----
EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new DisplayGmapEvent(targetIndex));
----

==== Method 2

The second way is to select the Google Map option under the dropdown list on the GUI. Each `PersonCard` has its own handler which will automatically raise a DisplayGmapEvent with the `PersonCard` index as parameter.

[source,java]
----
public void handleGoogleMap() {
    raise(new DisplayGmapEvent(Index.fromOneBased(this.displayedIndex)));
}
----

image::GmapSequenceDiagram3.png[width="750"]
_Figure 3.9.2.1 : GmapCommand GUI sequence diagram_

Since the GUI already has index tagged on every PersonCardPanel, there is no need for input validation.
Hence, the event can be raised directly and be handled in the `BrowserPanel` similar to **Method 1**.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Loading of Google Map data. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loading a modified URL into `WebView`. +
**Pros:** Much lesser codes needed, very easy for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Lacks flexibility in utilizing Google's map feature. +
**Alternative 2:** Use Google's Java client libraries. +
**Pros:** Allows much more flexibility and use directions, places and distance features. +
**Cons:** Currently do not need all these extra features. Integrating external libraries induces unnecessary overhead and is hard for new developers to understand the code.

---
// end::gmap[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Theme Changer Mechanism

This feature can be used from both the CLI and GUI.
Similar to the Google Map mechanism, the `ThemeCommand` object created when using the CLI is also a subclass of `Command` object.

*Refer to Figure 3.10.0.1*

==== Method 1

The creation of `ThemeCommand` object is also similar to most `Command` classes.

image::ThemeSequenceDiagram1.png[width="750"]
_Figure 3.10.1.1 : ThemeCommand parser sequence diagram_

`ThemeCommand` is created after `AddressBookParser` validation is successful.

image::ThemeSequenceDiagram2.png[width="750"]
_Figure 3.10.1.2 : ThemeCommand execution sequence diagram_

Validation within the **execute()** function will check for valid theme index or name.
Once this validation is successful, a `ChangeThemeEvent` event will be raised to `EventsCenter`.

[source,java]

----

@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

    // Theme name or index validation code

    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeEvent(targetIndex));
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_THEME_CHANGE_SUCCESS,
                UiPart.getThemeNameByIndex(this.targetIndex.getZeroBased())));

}
----

Event handling will then be done at `MainWindow` object class.

[source,java]
----
private void handleChangeThemeEvent(ChangeThemeEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    setTheme(THEME_FILE_FOLDER + THEME_LIST_DIR.get(event.targetIndex));
}
----

==== Method 2

The second method of utilizing the theme feature is from the GUI. Each buttons from the menu toolbar is tied to its own theme url.

For example:
[source,java]
----
@FXML
public void handleThemeModenaYoB() {
    setTheme(THEME_FILE_FOLDER + THEME_CSS_MODENA_YELLOWONBLACK);
}
----

The handling of theme buttons from Menu toolbar directly calls the **setTheme()** function.

==== Updating default page

The initial default web page displayed in `BrowserPanel` is a blank **default.html** page that uses a static darktheme CSS file for its styles.
Changing of styles using Java 8 API by adding external stylesheet only changes the GUI for Java 8's components.
The CSS styles for **default.html** will continue to reflect darktheme styles.

Hence, **default.html** file was modified to allow reading of parameters to indicate which themes are currently used, and update its local CSS file accordingly.

[source, javascript]
----
<script language="javascript">

    <!-- Code to retrieve theme css URI from parameters -->

    <!-- On page load, extract selected theme from parameter in the URL and edit respective css file -->
		window.onload = function(e){
			var theme  = getParameterByName('theme');
			if (theme) {
				var oldlink = document.getElementsByTagName("link").item(0);
				var newlink = document.createElement("link");

				newlink.setAttribute("rel", "stylesheet");
				newlink.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
				newlink.setAttribute("href", theme);

				document.getElementsByTagName("head").item(0).replaceChild(newlink, oldlink);
			}
		}
</script>
----

With this in place, whenever there's a change of themes, the **default.html** page will be reloaded with theme information supplied in its URL parameters.

[NOTE]
**Disclaimer:** +
Stylesheets and images of available themes were obtained online with slight modification of the CSS file.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storing of stylesheets. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Storing multiple CSS files offline and read on demand. +
**Pros:** Easier to modify stylesheets and for new developer to understand. +
**Cons:** Additional offline files to be stored. +
**Alternative 2:** Creating a static set of styles in java itself. +
**Pros:** Does not require additional offline files.  +
**Cons:** Harder to edit styles. Codes get more complicated and harder to understand, especially when there's alot of CSS rules.

---

**Aspect:** Updating of default web page styles. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Indicating theme data with default web page parameters. +
**Pros:** Can dynamically set web page css file to be accordance to current Java theme. +
**Cons:** Harder for new developers to understand. Requires understanding of Javascript. +
**Alternative 2:** Switching default web page to be transparent. +
**Pros:** Much easier for new developers to understand.  +
**Cons:** Default web page will be made obsolete. Unable to utilize it for other improvements and features in the future.

---
// end::theme[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import Mechanism

Just like the Google Map and Theme Changing feature, the **Import** feature can also be used from both the CLI and GUI.
Similarly, `ImportCommand` object is also a subclass of the `Command` object.

[NOTE]
Refer to Figure 3.9.0.1 for Class Diagram of ThemeCommand.

==== Method 1

Import feature can first be utilized using the CLI. The sequence diagram for parsing of import command input is also similar to **Theme Changer Mechanism**.

[NOTE]
Refer to Figure 3.10.1.1 for Sequence Diagram of Command Parsing.

Upon command execution after `ImportCommand` has been initialized, `AddressBookImportEvent` will be raised to the `EventsCenter`.

image::ImportSequenceDiagram1.png[width="750"]
_Figure 3.11.1.1 : Import CLI execution sequence diagram_

Event handling will then be done at the `Model` component by the `ModelManager`.
It will first process all records of person in the new addressbook. If the person name does not exist, it will add that person into the local addressbook.
If the person name already exist, it will check if both old and new person's details are identical. If it is not, it will update the local copy with the new one.

==== Method 2

Import command can also be accessed from the Menu toolbar.

[NOTE]
Refer to UserGuide 3.9 for screenshot of using Import from Menu toolbar.

image::ImportSequenceDiagram2.png[width="750"]
_Figure 3.11.1.1 : Import Feature GUI sequence diagram_

Java 8's FileChooser object is used to retrieve File URI from user.
File path validation will be done within the `MainWindow` when **handleImport()** is triggered.

[source, java]
----
public void handleImport() {
    try {
        // Attempt to read XML file
        addressBookOptional = XmlFileStorage.loadDataFromSaveFile(new File(selectedFile.getPath()));
        raise(new AddressBookImportEvent(selectedFile.getPath(), addressBookOptional));

        // Raise success message back to UI
        cmdResult = new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_IMPORT_SUCCESS, selectedFile.getPath()));
        raise(new NewResultAvailableEvent(cmdResult.feedbackToUser, true));

    } catch (DataConversionException e) { // Catch not well-formed XML files
        cmdResult = new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_XML_FORMAT_ERROR, selectedFile.getPath()));
        raise(new NewResultAvailableEvent(cmdResult.feedbackToUser, true));

    } catch (IOException e) { // Catch missing files
        cmdResult = new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_IMPORT_FILE_ERROR, selectedFile.getPath()));
        raise(new NewResultAvailableEvent(cmdResult.feedbackToUser, true));
    }
}
----

To validate the xml file, it will first attempt to read its content.
Non well-formed documents or file not found will be caught similar to **Method 1**.
Results will then be created `CommandResult` and be wrapped with `NewResultAvailableEvent` objects before being raised.

`NewResultAvailableEvent` will then be returned to `ResultDiplay` class for GUI update of action outcome.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Modes of import. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Append new person and update existing ones. +
**Pros:** Gives flexibility replacing entire addressbook or appending existing addressbook. +
**Cons:** Codes slightly more complex. +
**Alternative 2:** Replace entire addressbook with new one. +
**Pros:** Codes are more simple and easier for new developer to understand.  +
**Cons:** Does not give the user option to append or replace existing addressbook.

// end::import[]

// tag::birthday[]
=== Add person(s) Birthday

The `birthday` command is an improved version from `add` command. It allows user to add using with as phone number, birthday, email or tag.

The user can use this command with 'b/dd/mm/yyyy'

==== Design Considerations

It is implemented to add birthday detail so that relevant to the user to identify the birthday for up coming event. i.e. if a user want to have an event they can identify who's birthday is on this month or next month.

//end::birthday[]

---

// tag::photo[]
=== Add photo to person(s)

The adding `photo` is an new version for our app. It allows user to add photos for the person list that been added to Mybook, by clicking the command box and go to add photo
it will sent a request to open an file from the local location, and import photo to Mybook.

The user can use size of 100X100 of file 'png','jpg' or 'jpeg'

==== Design Considerations

It is implemented to add photo detail so that relevant to the user to identify user. i.e. if both user have same/similar pronunciation of name.

//end::photo[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
