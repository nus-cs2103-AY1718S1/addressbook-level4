[big]#*Introduction*#

The Classroom is a software that allows users to store contacts and manage them using a variety of features.
This guide provides information for you to set up and get started as a *The Classroom* developer.
This guide contains adequate details that can be useful if you are an experienced developer as well.
You are recommended to be proficient in java before you make changes and update the existing code as this guide includes
specific java syntax and features.


== Setting up

This section provides you with the necessary steps and requirements needed to run *The Classroom*.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later

+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+



. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default . +
Do not disable them. +
If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project on your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.

. Open IntelliJ
** If you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first.

. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.

. Click `Import Project`.

. Locate the `build.gradle` file, select it and click `OK`.

. Click `Open as Project`.

. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`).
** It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Setting up project dependencies

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write your code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

This section introduces the overall structure of *The Classroom* and the different models that governs the 4 main components
of the software. You will find this section to be particularly useful in providing an understanding on the interactions between these
components which will aid you in implementing new features to the application.

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::NewLogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::NewModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how you can implement certain features.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Class diagram of commands in Logic component_


As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Delete command state pushed into the undoStack_


As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3 : Add command state pushed into the undoStack_


[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.4 : Add command popped out of undoStack and pushed to redoStack upon undo command_


[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.5 : Sequence Diagram of Undo command_


The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.6 : Undone Add command purged upon execution of Clear command_


Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.7 : State of UndoRedoStack upon execution of List command_


The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 3.1.8 : Activity Diagram of new command activity_


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adds a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just overrides `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only includes commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Includes all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Uses `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]


// tag::favourite[]
=== Favourite mechanism

The favourite feature allows users to favourite or unfavourite a *single person* depending on whether the person is currently favourited or not. Favourited persons are all sorted to the top of the list in the user interface.

The favourite mechanism makes use of `FavouriteCommandParser` which is called by `AddressBookParser` when it parses the user input. `FavouriteCommandParser` then passes the specified index into FavouriteCommand to execute its code.

You can refer to the Sequence Diagram below for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("favourite 2")` API call.

image::FavouritePersonSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Sequence Diagram of Favourite command_


`FavouriteCommand` extends `UndoableCommand` and is thus also able to be undone/redone.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Data structure to hold the favourite status of a person +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates another class `FavouriteStatus` to hold data on whether the person is a favourite. +
**Pros:** Consistent with the other data fields like `Name` and `Email` +
**Cons:** Less memory efficient +
**Alternative 2:** Creates a boolean variable in `Person` class itself +
**Pros:** More memory efficient +
**Cons:** Not as intuitive since all other data fields are encapsulated in other classes +

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of `FavouriteCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses the existing `updatePerson(ReadOnlyPerson target, ReadOnlyPerson editedPerson)` method in `Model` +
**Pros:** Able to make use of existing code +
**Cons:** Might not be as speed efficient since another `Person` object is created just to toggle favourite status +
**Alternative 2:** Implements additional methods in `Model`, `AddressBook`, etc. to specifically toggle a person's favourite status +
**Pros:** Makes clear what the method is trying to do +
**Cons:** Is not necessary when existing code is able to perform the same action +
// end::favourite[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism

The find feature allows users to find persons based on keywords given. These keywords could belong to any of
the *5* link:#datafields[`DATAFIELDS`] that are attributed to a `Person`. These link:#datafields[`DATAFIELDS`] are associated to the given keywords through the use of
prefixes that are unique to each link:#datafields[`DATAFIELD`].

Below are the prefixes and their corresponding link:#datafields[`DATAFIELDS`]:
****
PREFIX -> DATAFIELD +
`n/` -> name +
`p/` -> phone +
`a/` -> address +
`e/` -> email +
`t/` -> tag
****

The following sequence diagram further illustrate to you on how the find mechanism works.

image::find.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Sequence Diagram of Find command_


==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Process of checking keywords to data in the contact list. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Explicitly checks every field for given array list of keywords. +
**Pros:** Method is effective and reliable in executing command successfully. +
**Cons:** May cause complications due to checking every object in the array list. +
**Alternative 2:** Introduces a conditional operation. +
**Pros:** Reduces chances of error. +
**Cons:** Code may not be concise.

// end::find[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The sort feature allows users to sort the person list according to the `DATAFIELD` that they want. Note that favourite sorting comes first before sorting by `DATAFIELD`. +

Current `DATAFIELD` entries that are allowed are: `Name`, `Phone`, `Email` and `Address`. +

Using `-ignorefav` after `DATAFIELD` will sort the contact list without prioritising favourites first. +

Using `-reverse` after `DATAFIELD` will sort the contact list according to the `DATAFIELD` but in *reverse order* +

The sort feature uses *JavaFX 8's* `SortedList` to wrap around the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager` to enable sorting. This is because `FilteredList` is *unmodifiable* as of *JavaFX 8* and thus cannot be sorted. +

The sequence diagram below shows how the sort command works in the `Logic` component:

image::FavouritePersonSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Sequence Diagram of Sort command_


Firstly, `SortCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `SortCommand` with the user-specified `DATAFIELD`. `SortCommand` then calls the `sortByDataFieldFirst` method in `ModelManager` which sets the appropriate order of `Comparators` for `SortedList`. +

`Comparators` are gotten from the `ComparatorUtil` class.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `Comparators` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Consolidates all the `Comparators` in the class `ComparatorUtil` and provide getter methods for them +
**Pros:** Allows for code reuse, able to extend easily when more `DATAFIELD` details are added +
**Cons:** More planning required for implementation +
**Alternative 2:** Creates `Comparators` in `ModelManager` and use them to sort +
**Pros:** Less planning required for implementation +
**Cons:** Results in messy code +

// end::sort[]

// tag::tags[]
=== Tags listing mechanism

The tags listing feature allows users to view a list of the existing tags instead of the contact list by making use of `Events`. The `tags` command raises a `ShowTagListViewEvent` when executed while other commands that modify the contact list like `find` raise `ShowPersonListViewEvent` when executed. +

The `MainWindow` subscribes to these 2 events to determine when it should set `personListPanel` or `tagListPanel` visible.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Clearing out `Tags` from `MasterTagList` that are not being used by any person +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** When updating or deleting a person, gets the old person's `Tags` and iterate through the whole contact list to find out if the `Tag` is still being used +
**Pros:** Easier to implement +
**Cons:** Slow run speed +
**Alternative 2:** Includes a person list in `Tag` to hold information of the people who have that `Tag` and remove the `Tag` when there is no one left in the list. +
**Pros:** Fast run speed +
**Cons:** More storage space needed and harder to implement +

// end::tags[]

// tag::addremove[]
// tag::addtag[]
=== Tag addition mechanism

The add tag feature allows users to add specified `Tag(s)` cumulatively to specified `Indexes`.

The following sequence diagram shows you on how the add tag operation works:

image::addTag.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6.1 : Sequence Diagram of Add Tag command_

As you can see above, execution of `AddTagCommand` is governed by the `addTag` method located in the `Model` interface and implemented by
`ModelManager`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of AddTag command parser.  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows range of `Index` to be accepted as parameters. +
**Pros:** Allows greater efficiency in adding multiple `Tags` instead of doing it singly. +
**Cons:** Various conditional statements to consider instance which involves range of index. +
**Alternative 2:** Creates a separate class for ranges of index. +
**Pros:** Better comprehensibility of code and increase abstraction. +
**Cons:** Will increase coupling between Range class and Index class. +

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of AddTag command. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Executes user input and provides one result of command output. +
**Pros:** With current implementation, it allows for multiple addition of `Tags` in one command execution. +
**Cons:** The use of the `Undo/Redo` command may not be applicable. +
**Alternative 2:** Incorporates mechanism such as Stacks to store individual addition of `Tag`. +
**Pros:** Complements the use of `Undo/Redo`. +
**Cons:** Current method of adding tags has to be amended to accommodate the use of the new mechanism. +

// end::addtag[]

// tag::removetag[]
=== Tag removal mechanism

The remove tag feature allows users to remove specified `Tag(s)` either from specified `Indexes` or from the whole address book. +

The distinction in execution of the command lies in the format of the user input as you can see from the activity diagram below.

image::RemoveTagActivityDiag.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.7.1a : Activity Diagram of Remove Tag command_

The following sequence diagram shows you how the remove operation works:

image::removeTag.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.7.1b : Sequence Diagram of Remove Tag command_

As you can see, execution of `RemoveTagCommand` is governed by the `removeTag` method located in the `Model` interface and implemented by
`ModelManager`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of RemoveTag command parser.  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows range of `Index` to be accepted as parameters. +
**Pros:** Allows greater efficiency in removing multiple `Tags` instead of doing it singly. +
**Cons:** Various conditional statements to consider instance which involves range of index. +
**Alternative 2:** Creates a separate class for ranges of index. +
**Pros:** Better comprehensibility of code and increase abstraction. +
**Cons:** Will increase coupling between Range class and Index class. +

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of RemoveTag command. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Executes user input and provides one result of command output. +
**Pros:** With current implementation, it allows for multiple removal of `Tags` in one command execution. +
**Cons:** The use of the `Undo/Redo` command may not be applicable. +
**Alternative 2:** Incorporates mechanism such as Stacks to store individual removal of `Tag`. +
**Pros:** Complements the use of `Undo/Redo`. +
**Cons:** Current method of removing tags has to accommodate the use of the new mechanism. +

// end::removetag[]
// end::addremove[]

// tag::remarkchecklist[]
=== Remark CheckList Implementation

The remark checklist serves as command to allow users to keep notes on individual persons. +
We want our remark command to function like a todo list, which enables users to add remarks to a person based on a specific task they want to do with the person. +
Since remarks can be different for different persons, it was placed under the Person class to allow for easy retrieval. +
Since it is saved under the Person class, we are able to utilise the ReadOnlyPerson to compare persons, or extract specific information without risking a corruption in the storage file. +

image::PersonRemarkAssociation.png[width ="400"]
_Figure 3.8.1a : Association Diagram of Person and Remarks_

As users accomplish tasks that were associated with specific persons, we want to allow them to remove remarks at any point in time. +
To allow for easy user manipulation of the remarks of different persons, as there can be multiple remarks appended to a person, we provided an `addremark` and `removeremark` command to compliment the remark checklist +
From the `addremark` command, users can add remarks to a target person without clearing the existing remarks pertaining to that person. +
From the `removeremark` command, users can select specific remarks to remove based on the remark index and target person index. +
Implementation of both commands also can allow for mutiple addition and removal of remarks, although only one person can be affected at one time. +

image::UpdateAddRemarkSequenceDiagram.png[width ="900"]
_Figure 3.8.1b : Sequence Diagram of AddRemark command_

image::UpdateRemoveRemarkSequenceDiagram.png[width ="900"]
_Figure 3.8.1c : Sequence Diagram of RemoveRemark command_

On top of this, we decided that remark checklist UI should be updated with any changes, either to selection or file storage. +
Thus, we subscribed the remark panel UI to any person selection changes or person storage changes to allow for a constantly updated UI. +

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
    // ... Update display after person panel selection changed logic ...
}

@Subscribe
public void handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent event) {
    // ... Update display after address book changed logic ...
}
----

Since remarks tend to be lengthy, we decided that a large amount of space on the app should be dedicated to them. +
Instead of implementing similar UI design as the tags feature, we decided to display the remarks using a large stackpane. +

image::UI.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.8.1b : UI showing remarks list display on the right hand side of screen_

[NOTE]
Remarks can not be added when adding a person. It can only be done to a person already existing in the address book.

[NOTE]
If a person is without a remark, he/she still contains an ArrayList of empty remarks. +
ArrayList should never contain null objects.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Data structure used to store remarks +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses Arraylist of remarks +
**Pros:** Arraylists naturally update the index of its list, so we do not need additional functions to handle indexing. +
**Cons:** Time complexity of arraylist remove is O(N) on average, so it might take some time if there are many remarks on a person. +
**Alternative 2:** Uses Hashtable of remarks, with index as key +
**Pros:** Time complexity of O(1) on average, so addition and removal of remarks will always be fast.  +
**Cons:** Additional functions need to be implemented to help handle indexing of the remarks, and the functions also need to be O(1) in order for hashtable use to be a better choice. +

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** UI display of remarks +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a large stackpane to display the remarks on a separate pane +
**Pros:** More organised way of displaying remarks as they tend to be long and by doing so, remarks can be view more easily +
**Cons:** Unable to view the remarks of each person from the person card list at one glance, and can only be viewed when selecting a person +
**Alternative 2:** Keeps remarks as a displayable field under person card, similar to tags +
**Pros:** Remarks can always be viewed from every scene and no additional edits to the UI and code needs to be done +
**Cons:** Extremely messy and hard to read when a person has multiple remarks +

=== Link mechanism

The link command allows users to add twitter links to a person, so as to make use of the messaging feature on twitter.
By having a link field under each person, we are able to load a twitter link when the person is selected.

image::person.png[width="400"]
_Figure 3.9.1a : Attributes of Person class_

Since only one twitter link is allowed for each person, we have designed the link command to replace any old twitter links
with the current twitter link used in the link command so that it is easy to use for the user.

image::LinkActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.9.1b : Activity Diagram showing how link command is used_

[NOTE]
Only twitter link are allowed to be added.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Messaging platform +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Ensures Browserpanel to open a twitter page+
**Pros:** Browser panel is already implemented and tested to open urls well without crashing the program in offline mode, so not much additional code is required +
**Cons:** Messaging feature depends on the twitter server, so it will be down when twitter is down +
**Alternative 2:** Creates a messaging platform in the application itself +
**Pros:** Do not need to create a twitter account to use messaging features +
**Cons:** Need to setup and maintain a server (still need a server) and write additional code that will require extensive testings to make sure that it does not disrupt the program's core functions. +

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* You can control the logging level using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file.(See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* You can obtain the `Logger` for a class using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

You can control certain properties of the application (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how you can render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how you can deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps for you to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. +

In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means that you can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.
To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

* Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
* Require you to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

. Modify the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to show the total number of people in the address book.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
