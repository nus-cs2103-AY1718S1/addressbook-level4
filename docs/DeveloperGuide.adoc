== Introduction

The Myth's Book is an address book dedicated for university students to store useful information such
as websites, phone numbers and emails of the people around them for personal usage. The application helps students
to keep track of birthday dates and upcoming events through a calendar and facilitate convenient access to their friend's website
and even Google Maps location through the in-built browser panel in the application. Furthermore, there are many
useful tools such as finding group tags (e.g. friends, neighbours) and switching themes for better user preference and usability.

The Myth's Book is a `Command Line Input` based software which helps caters to students who are efficient and comfortable
in typing out command line inputs to manipulate with information of their contacts in the address book.
The Myth's Book is a software application that is coded in `Java` programming language.

== About

This developer guide will guide you on how to set up the application software on IntelliJ IDEA and
allow you to understand more about the process, features and structure of the application software
as you are updating, improving and debugging The Myth's Book.

== Setting up

This section guides you on how to set up The Myth's Book on IntelliJ IDEA.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

Before you start coding, it is advisable that you should read and recognise the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.

link:#the-myths-book---developer-guide[Back To Top]

== Design

This section enables you to understand the structure of the application software and its components.

=== Architecture

This section enables you to understand the overall architecture of the application software.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

In the `Main` component of the software, there is only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].

`MainApp` is responsible for,

* Launching of the application where it initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them together.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

In the software, link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

Two of the classes below play important roles in the software at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 4.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

link:#the-myths-book---developer-guide[Back To Top]

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::events[]
=== Events mechanism

Events mechanism activates the Events mode in The Myth's Book, where the users are locked to using commands pertaining to `Events`,
which are `AddEventCommand` and `DeleteEventCommand`, and commands that are common between Events and Persons, such as `ExitCommand`,
`HelpCommand` and more.

The events mechanism also lists down the list of events, which is facilitated by an `EventList`, which is stored in The Myth's Book.
Similar to the PersonList and TagList, the list contains the different events with their information given by the user. This command inherits from `Command`.

As seen in the diagram below, `EventsCommand` inherits `Command`, which means its state is not saved by the address book, and it cannot be undone after executing the command.

image::EventsCommandDiagram1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.2.1 EventsCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of EventsCommand is processed in this way:

. User will execute `events` to activate the `Events` mode.
. The execution of `events` posts events `TogglePanelEvent`, `PersonPanelUnselectEvent` and `AccessWebsiteRequestEvent`, which will
  then be listened and handled by `handleToggleEvent` in `MainWindow`, `handleUnselectOfPersonCardEvent` in `MainWindow` and `handleAccessWebsiteEvent` in `BrowserPanel` respectively.
. The `EventListPanel` will then be brought to front over `PersonListPanel`, showing the list of events from `EventList`.
. Subsequently, `DetailsPanel`, which shows a person's details, will be removed and be replaced by `EventsDetailsPanel` which shows an event's details.
. The `BrowserPanel` section will also display `Google Maps` when `events` is executed.

Code of `EventsCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public class EventsCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... events logic ...
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new TogglePanelEvent(COMMAND_WORD));
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new PersonPanelUnselectEvent());
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new AccessWebsiteRequestEvent("https://maps.google.com/"));
    }
}
----

Listener for TogglePanelEvent in MainWindow.java:
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleToggleEvent(TogglePanelEvent event) {
    handleToggle(event.selectedPanel);
}
----

Bringing of EventListPanel to front in MainWindow.java:
[source,java]
----
public void handleToggle(String selectedPanel) {
    if (selectedPanel.equals(EventsCommand.COMMAND_WORD)) {
        eventListPanelPlaceholder.toFront();
    } else if (selectedPanel.equals(ListCommand.COMMAND_WORD)) {
        personListPanelPlaceholder.toFront();
    }
}
----

Listener for PersonPanelUnselectEvent in MainWindow.java:
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleUnselectOfPersonCardEvent(PersonPanelUnselectEvent event) {
    detailsPanel = new DetailsPanel();
    detailsPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().clear();
    detailsPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(detailsPanel.getRoot());
}
----

Listener for AccessWebsiteRequestEvent in BrowserPanel.java:
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleAccessWebsiteEvent(AccessWebsiteRequestEvent event) {
    handleWebsiteAccess(event.website);
}
----

Displaying of Google Maps in BrowserPanel.java:
[source,java]
----
public void handleWebsiteAccess(String website) {
    loadPage(website);
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the events operation works:

As seen in the diagram below, when `events` is typed into the command line input, a new `EventsCommand` is created.

image::EventsCommandDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.2.2 EventsCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `EventsCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extends to `Command` +
**Pros:** Developers do not need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand` class. +
**Cons:** Users may want to undo `EventsCommand` as they may not have wanted to be in Events mode. +
**Alternative 2:** Extends to `UndoableCommand` +
**Pros:** Users can undo `EventsCommand` when they mistype the command. +
**Cons:** Developers need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand`. Unnecessary to extend to `UndoableCommand` since users can type `ListCommand` to go back to Persons mode. +
// end::events[]

// tag::addevent[]
=== Add Event mechanism

An `Event` is created by `EventName`, `Date` and `Address` as the details of the event.
It also implements `ReadOnlyEvent` interface. The class diagram is shown in Figure 5.3.1 below.

image::eventclassdiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 5.3.1 Event Class Diagram_

Add event mechanism adds an Event which stores in the The Myth's Book. The add event mechanism is facilitated by an `EventList`, which is stored in The Myth's Book. Similar to the PersonList and TagList, the list contains the
different events with their information given by the user. This command inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

From Figure 5.3.2 below, it is visible that `AddEventCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand` which is an extra layer between abstract `Command` class in which the AddEventCommand
can be undoable, where the previous state of The Myth's Book before the event is saved.

image::AddEventDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 5.3.2 AddEventCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of AddEventCommand is processed in this way:

. User will execute and create a new `AddEventCommand` so as to add an event into The Myth's Book.
. When `executeUndoable()` of `AddEventCommand` is called, `model.addEvent()` in the method will be processed.
. The `internalList` of the AddressBook will store all the Events.
. After `internalList` has added the event, function `updateFilterEventList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENT)` is called
  to update the list being filtered and also call an event `indicatedAddressBookChanged()` to show that the addressBook has be updated
  with additional event.

The illustration of the execution is illustrated in Figure 5.3.3 below.

image::addeventmodelseqdiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 5.3.3 AddEventCommand Model Sequence Diagram_

Code of `AddEventCommand`:
[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        try {
            model.addEvent(toAdd);
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, toAdd));
        } catch (DuplicateEventException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_EVENT);
        }
    }
----
[source,java]
----
    public class UniqueEventList implements Iterable<Event> {

        private final ObservableList<Event> internalList = FXCollections.observableArrayList();
        ...
        public void add(ReadOnlyEvent toAdd) throws DuplicateEventException {
            requireNonNull(toAdd);
            if (contains(toAdd)) {
                throw new DuplicateEventException();
            }
            internalList.add(new Event(toAdd));
        }
        ...
    }
----

Code from `ModelManager`
[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public synchronized void addEvent(ReadOnlyEvent event) throws DuplicateEventException {
        addressBook.addEvent(event);
        updateFilteredEventList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
    }
----


==== Design Consideration
**Aspect:** Implementation of `AddEventCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extends to UndoableCommand +
**Pros:** Developer can undo their command when they do not want to add the event. +
**Cons:** Developer has to understand the implementation of UndoableCommand +

---
**Aspect:** How does add event executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Take in EventName(event) , Date(event) and Address(person) +
**Pros:** Simple to implement as add event uses EventName and Date from Event and Address from Person due to similar CliSyntax. +
**Cons:** Developer might get confused with the different use of imports as EventName and Date are from events while Address is from person. +
// end::addevent[]

// tag::deleteevent[]
=== Delete Event mechanism

Delete event mechanism deletes an event which is stored in the The Myth's Book, which will then be updated in the `Calendar` upon deletion.

The delete event mechanism is facilitated by an `EventList`, which is stored in The Myth's Book. Similar to the PersonList and TagList, the list contains the
different events with their information given by the user. This command inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

As seen in Figure 5.4.1 below, `DeleteEventCommand` inherits `UndoableCommand` which is an extra layer between abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone.
When `DeleteEventCommand` is executed, the previous state of the address book before the deleting of an event is saved.

image::DeleteEventCommandDiagram1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.4.1 DeleteEventCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of DeleteEventCommand is processed in this way:

. User will execute `events` to enter Events mode, and user can look through the list of events that he or she may want to delete.

. User will then execute `deleteevent 2`, with `2` being the `index` of the event that the user wants to delete, provided by the executed `events`.

. The `EventList` in `AddressBook` will then delete the event specified by the user's execution of `deleteevent 2`.

. The deleting of event in `AddressBook` posts an event `PopulateRequestEvent`, which will then be listened and handled by `handlePopulateEvent` in `MainWindow`.

. The `Calendar` will look through the `EventList` and update the calendar by populating the dates of the calendar where there are events.

Code of `DeleteEventCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public class DeleteEventCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {

        // ... delete event logic ...

        List<ReadOnlyEvent> lastShownList = model.getFilteredEventList();

        ReadOnlyEvent eventToDelete = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

        model.deleteEvent(eventToDelete);
    }
}
----

Removing of event in AddressBook.java:
[source,java]
----
public class AddressBook implements ReadOnlyAddressBook {
    public boolean deleteEvent(ReadOnlyEvent event) throws EventNotFoundException {
        if (events.remove(event)) {
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new PopulateRequestEvent(events));
            return true;
        } else {
            throw new EventNotFoundException();
        }
    }
}
----

private void handlePopulateEvent(PopulateRequestEvent request) {
    calendar.populateUpdatedCalendar(request.eventList, YearMonth.now());

            ap.setStyle("calendar-color");
            for (Event event1 : eventList) {
                // ... populate updated calendar logic ...
                if (newDate.equals(event1.getDate().toString())) {

                    ap.setStyle("-fx-background-color: #ffebcd;");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete event operation works:

As seen in the diagram below, when `deleteevent 1` is typed into the command line input, a new `DeleteEventCommand` is created.

image::DeleteEventCommandDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.4.2 DeleteEventCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

As seen in Figure 5.4.3, when `deleteevent 1` is executed in `DeleteEventCommand`, it will remove the event in `UniqueEventList`.

image::DeleteEventCommandDiagram3.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.4.3 DeleteEventCommand Logic & Model Sequence Diagram_

As seen in the diagram below, when `deleteEvent` is executed in `AddressBook`, it will post an event `PopulateRequestEvent` in`EventsCenter`, which is handled by `MainWindow` and `Calendar`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteEventCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extends to `UndoableCommand` +
**Pros:** Users can undo their command when they make a mistake in deleting an event. +
**Cons:** Developer needs to understand the implementation of UndoableCommand. +
**Alternative 2:** Extends to `Command` +
**Pros:** Developers do not need to understand the implementation of UndoableCommand. +
**Cons:** Users are unable to undo their command when they make a mistake in deleting an event. +
// end::deleteevent[]

// tag::switch[]
=== Switch Theme mechanism

The switch theme mechanism is facilitated by a `ThemesList`, which resides inside `AddressBook`. `Themes` contains a list of CSS files, in which each file are of differing colour themes for the application user interface. It sets the theme of the application to the theme specified by the index given by the user. This command will inherit from `Command`.

As seen in the diagram below, `SwitchThemeCommand` inherits `Command`, which means its state is not saved by the address book, and it cannot be undone after executing the command.

image::SwitchThemeCommandDiagram1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.1 SwitchThemeCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of SwitchThemeCommand is processed in this way:

. User has just launched the application. The `Themes` will be initialised based on `CurrentTheme` which resides in `ModelManager`.

. User will execute `themes` to look through the existing colour themes, and pick one that he or she wants.

. User will then execute `switch 2`, with `2` being the `index` of the theme that the user prefers, provided by the executed `themes`.

. The `ThemesList` will take the `index` provided by the user, and return a `String` of the CSS file name based on the `index`.

. The execution of `switch 2` posts an event `ChangeThemeRequestEvent`, which will then be listened and handled by `handleChangeThemeEvent` in `MainWindow`.

. The `Stylesheets` of the `MainWindow` will then remove the current existing CSS file, which is the current theme, and add the given `String` of the CSS file into `Stylesheets`.
  That will set the current colour theme of The Myth's Book to the preferred colour theme.

. Subsequently, the colour theme chosen will update `CurrentTheme` of The Myth's Book in `UserPrefs` through `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`. This will
  allow the application to check the latest colour theme before the application was closed and sets the application's colour theme to it through `MainWindow`.

Code of SwitchThemeCommand:
[source, java]
----
public class SwitchThemeCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... switch theme logic ...
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent(themeToChange));
    }
}
----

Listener for ChangeThemeRequestEvent in MainWindow.java:
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleChangeThemeEvent(ChangeThemeRequestEvent event) {
    handleChangeTheme(event.theme);
    browserPanel.setDefaultPage(event.theme);
    logic.setCurrentTheme(getCurrentTheme());
}
----

Removing and adding of CSS file into Stylesheets in MainWindow.java:
[source, java]
----
public void handleChangeTheme(String theme) {
    if (getRoot().getStylesheets().size() > 1) {
        getRoot().getStylesheets().remove(CURRENT_THEME_INDEX);
    }
    getRoot().getStylesheets().add(VIEW_PATH + theme);
}
----

Setting of default theme of application based on UserPrefs in MainWindow.java:
[source, java]
----
private void setWindowDefaultTheme(UserPrefs prefs) {
    getRoot().getStylesheets().add(prefs.getTheme());
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the switch theme operation works:

As seen in the diagram below, when `switch 1` is typed into the command line input, a new `SwitchThemeCommand` is created.

image::SwitchThemeCommandDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.2 SwitchThemeCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

As seen in the diagram below, when `switch 1` is executed in `SwitchThemeCommand`, it will post `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` to the `EventsCenter`.

image::SwitchThemeCommandDiagram3.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.3 SwitchThemeCommand Logic, EventsCenter & UI Sequence Diagram_

Upon detecting `ChangeThemeRequestEvent`, `MainWindow` will call `handleChangeTheme` to handle the event.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `SwitchThemeCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extending to `Command` class. +
**Pros:** Developers do not need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand` class. +
**Cons:** `SwitchThemeCommand` cannot be undone and have to repeatedly call command to switch to different themes. +
**Alternative 2:** Extending to `UndoableCommand` class. +
**Pros:** Might be more favourable to users to undo `SwitchThemeCommand` if he/she switch to an incorrect theme. +
**Cons:** Developers need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand`. Difficult to implement. +

---

**Aspect:** How switch theme executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Taking in index (type Integer) as the argument. +
**Pros:** Simple to implement since the index will tally with `Themes`. Simple to use since users don't have to remember the names and look at the index in `Themes`. +
**Cons:** Maybe less favourable for users when the size of `Themes` increase. +
**Alternative 2:** Taking in theme's name (type String) as the argument. +
**Pros:** Might be more favourable for long-time users since names may be easier to remember than numbers after using the application for a long time. +
**Cons:** Harder to implement and test. +

=== Theme List mechanism

The theme list mechanism is facilitated by a `ThemesWindow`, which resides in `MainWindow`. `ThemesWindow` is a pop-up window that is populated by `Themes.html`, a HTML file
consisting of a list of available colour themes in The Myth's Book.

`Themes.html` will then populate `ThemesWindow`. This command will inherit from `Command`.

As seen in the diagram below, the `ThemeListCommand` inherts from `Command`, which means its state is not saved by the address book, and it cannot be undone after executing the command.

image::ThemeListCommandDiagram1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.6.1 ThemeListCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of ThemeListCommand is processed in this way:

. When the user execute `themes`, it posts an event `ShowThemeRequestEvent`, which will then be listened and handled by `handleShowThemeEvent` in `MainWindow`.

. `gradle` will then convert the document `Themes.adoc` into `Themes.html` file.

. `ThemesWindow` will then be activated, and will be populated by `Themes.html`.

Code of ThemeListCommand:
[source, java]
----
public class ThemeListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... theme list logic ...
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowThemeRequestEvent());
    }
}
----

Code of ThemesWindow.java:
[source,java]
----
public ThemesWindow() {
    // ... themes window logic ...
    dialogStage = createDialogStage(TITLE, null, scene);
    dialogStage.setMaximized(true);
    FxViewUtil.setStageIcon(dialogStage, ICON);

    String userGuideUrl = getClass().getResource(THEMES_FILE_PATH).toString();
    browser.getEngine().load(userGuideUrl);
}

public void show() {
    // ... show logic ...
    dialogStage.showAndWait();
}
----

Listener for ShowThemeRequestEvent in MainWindow.java:

@Subscribe
private void handleShowThemesEvent(ShowThemeRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    handleThemes();
}
----

Creating and showing of ThemesWindow in MainWindow.java:
[source,java]
----
@FXML
public void handleThemes() {
    ThemesWindow themesWindow = new ThemesWindow();
    themesWindow.show();
}

Including of Themes.html in build.gradle:
[source,java]
----
task deployOfflineDocs(type: Copy) {
    into('src/main/resources/docs')

    from ("${asciidoctor.outputDir}/html5") {
        include 'stylesheets/*'
        include 'images/*'
        include 'UserGuide.html'
        include 'Themes.html'
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the theme list operation works:

As seen in the diagram below, when `themes` is typed into the command line input, a new `ThemeListcommand` is created.

image::ThemeListCommandDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.6.2 ThemeListCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

As seen in the diagram below, when `themes` is executed in `ThemeListCommand`, it will post `ShowThemeRequestEvent` to the `EventsCenter`, which will be handled by `MainWindow` through `handleThemes`.

image::ThemeListCommandDiagram3.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.6.3 ThemeListCommand Logic, EventsCenter & UI Diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How theme list executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Showing the list of themes through a pop-up window populated by a HTML file. +
**Pros:** Improve user-friendliness because users will be able to see how each theme looks like, and will be able to decide and choose which theme they prefer easily. +
**Cons:** Developers need to learn the implementation of `gradle`, `asciidoctor` and `deployOfflineDocs`.
**Alternative 2:** Showing the list of themes through `CommandResult` in `ResultDisplay`.
**Pros:** Simple to implement since the list of themes can come as `String` and do not need to convert asciidoc to HTML file. Developers do not need to learn implementation of `gradle`, `asciidoctor` and `deployOfflineDocs`. +
**Cons:** Reduce user-friendliness since users will not be able to see how each theme looks like, and will not be able to decide and choose preferred theme. +
// end::switch[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The sort mechanism sorts the contacts based on their names inside the `addressbook` of the `ModelManager`.
When the sort method is executed, it organizes the position of the people existing in the `addressbook`
based on their names in alphabetical order. The sort mechanism touches all components of the software application
but mainly involving the logic and model component.

In the figure [Figure 5.7.1] below, the `SortCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`
which is an extra layer between abstract `Command` class which belongs to the Logic Component.
This allows the SortCommand to be undoable, where the previous state of the address book before sorting is saved.

image::SortCommandLogicClassDiagram.PNG[width="600"]
_Figure 5.7.1 SortCommand Logic Class Diagram_

Suppose a user has an unorganized list of contacts and executes the `SortCommand` to organize his contacts.

The execution of SortCommand is processed in this way:

. User will execute and create a new `SortCommand` so as to sort the address book.
. When `executeUndoableCommand()` of `SortCommand` is called, `model.sort()` in the method will be processed.
. The `internalList` of the address book is then accessed and sorted through a `lambda` function which
  compares the name of everyone and necessarily switches the position between contacts throughout the `internalList` by comparing names between person r1 and r2 sequentially.
. After `internalList` is sorted, function `updateFilterPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` is called
  to update the list being filtered and also call an event `indicatedAddressBookChanged()`
  to update the `PersonListPanel` of the GUI being shown.

Code of `SortCommand.java` and its method `executeUndoableCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public class SortCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    // ... SortCommand logic ...
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        model.sort();
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }
}
----

Code of sort method inside `ModelManager.java`:
[source,java]
----
@Override
public synchronized void sort() {
    addressBook.sort();
    updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
    indicateAddressBookChanged();
}
----

Code of sort method inside `UniquePersonList.java` using a lambda function to sort `internalList`:
[source,java]
----
public void sort() {
    internalList.sort((r1, r2) -> (
            r1.getName().toString().compareTo(r2.getName().toString())));
}

----
The following sequence diagrams shows how the sort operation works:
As seen in the figure [Figure 5.7.2] below, when sort is typed into command line input, new `SortCommand` is created.

image::SortCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="600"]
_Figure 5.7.2 SortCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

As seen in the figure [Figure 5.7.3] below, when `executeUndoableCommand` is called in SortCommand class, it will call the sort function in ModelManager.
It will call the sort() function of its own class until it reaches InternalList.sort() where the sorting of
contacts positions based on their names will be executed.

image::SortCommandModelSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="600"]
_Figure 5.7.3 SortCommand Model Sequence Diagram_

Finally, the execution will create a sorted addressbook where the names of contacts are alphabetically sorted
and shown in the `PersonListPanel`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `SortCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** extending to `UndoableCommand` class +
**Pros:** Sort method call is able to be undone if needed as it now inherits from the Super Class. +
**Cons:** Developers might need to understand how `UndoableCommand` works before implementation. +
**Alternative 2:** Just extend to `Command` class +
**Pros:** Does not need understanding of `UndoableCommand` class. +
**Cons:** Unable to undo sort method and work from previous state of address book if user has called `SortCommand` to sort address book.

---
**Aspect:** Implementation of how sort executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compare and sort the names of every individual alphabetically. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and uses less complexity. +
**Cons:** Unable to sort based on user preferences like email, phone number. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all types of sorting like sorting phone numbers and emails. +
**Pros:** Might be more favourable for user who have specific needs to collate certain information such as
 email or phone number about his contacts in an alphanumeric order. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement and wastes memory space as sorting might be unnecessary and complex for general users
          since main goal is to keep address book organized. +

//end::sort[]

// tag::access[]
=== Access Website mechanism

The access website mechanism has an `AccessCommand` that allows users to access the website by stating the
index of the desired contact in the contact list viewed.
The implementation of the access website mechanism is mostly done in the `UI`, `Model`, and `Logic` component.
The `AccessCommand` class inherits from the `Command` class.

Suppose a user would like to access one of his contacts website that is listed in the `PersonListPanel` of the address book
and executes the `AccessCommand` to access the website.

The execution of AccessCommand is processed in this way:

. User will input `access index` where `index` refers to the index of the person listed in the `PersonListPanel` in GUI.
. Input of user will be parse as an argument through the AddressBookParser and AccessCommandParser to extract the index.
. A new `AccessCommand` with the index inputted will be created.
. The method `execute()` of the `AccessCommand` will then be processed,
 where the person of the website that the user wants to access will be obtained through the
 index of the `lastShownList` and stored into `person` variable which is of `ReadOnlyPerson` data-type.
. The `EventsCenter` will then post a new `AccessWebsiteRequestEvent` with parameter input of the `website` of the `person` variable.
. The `AccessWebsiteRequestEvent` event would then be handled by an event handler `handleAccessWebsiteEvent` in `BrowserPanel`.
. The event handler will help to load the website of the person through the browser panel based on the website inputted.

Code of `AccessCommand` and its method `execute()`:
[source,java]
----
public class AccessCommand extends Command {
    private final Index targetIndex;

    // ... AccessCommand logic ...
    public AccessCommand(Index targetIndex) {
        this.targetIndex = targetIndex;
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyPerson person = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        String name = person.getName().toString();
        String website = person.getWebsite().toString();

        if (website.equals("NIL")) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_WEBSITE);
        }

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new AccessWebsiteRequestEvent(website));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_ACCESS_PERSON_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased(), name));
    }
}
----

Code of how accessing website event is handled in `BrowserPanel`:
[source,java]
----
public class BrowserPanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    // ... BrowserPanel logic ...

    public void handleWebsiteAccess(String website) {
        browserPanel.loadPage(website);
    }

    public void loadPage(String url) {
        Platform.runLater(() -> browser.getEngine().load(url));
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleAccessWebsiteEvent(AccessWebsiteRequestEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        handleWebsiteAccess(event.website);
    }
}
----

Through the sequence diagrams below, you can see how the code executes when a user
inputs `access 1` into the command line.

When a user inputs `access 1`, it will trigger `LogicManager` to parse the arguments
into the `AddressBookParser` so that it can create a new `AccessCommand` and store it as a `Command`.

Sequence diagram for `Logic` Component for `AccessCommand` and its execution:

image::AccessCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 5.8.1 AccessCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

After creating a new `AccessCommand`, `LogicManager` will call execute on `AccessCommand`
and this will result in the website of the person at the index inputted to be attained through the `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
of the `ModelManager`. The website attained will be parsed through an event request and event handler.
Finally, the website will then be loaded onto the browser of the `BrowserPanel` of the `MainWindow`.

The process can be observed in the sequence diagram below
where it shows the sequence of `execute()` method of `AccessCommand` and its event handling.

_Figure 5.8.2 AccessCommand Model, EventsCenter & UI Sequence Diagram_

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How accessing a website of a person executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new event request and event handler for AccessCommand. +
**Pros:** Able to have more features like AccessWebsite and Select feature that is able to exist concurrently in the application. +
**Cons:** Having the current select feature which is to search for names of contact of Google is quite unnecessary. +
**Alternative 2:** Change the code of event request and event handler related to SelectCommand to allow users to access website of their contacts instead
of creating a search on contacts name through the browser panel. +
**Pros:** Select feature which seems unnecessary is replaced with a more useful feature of AccessWebsite. +
**Cons:** Will not be able to replace the select feature anymore which might be important for other aspects such as creating a Person Card Viewer
which is important for GUI enhancement. +

//end::access[]

// tag::locate[]
=== Location mechanism
The location mechanism has a `LocationCommand` that allows users to access the address through Google Maps Search
by stating the index of the desired contact in the contact list viewed.
The implementation of the location mechanism is mostly done in the `UI`, `Model`, and `Logic` component
and is very similar to the access website mechanism in terms of implementation and execution sequence.
The `LocationCommand` class inherits from the `Command` class.

Suppose a user would like to access one of his contacts address that is listed in the `PersonListPanel` of the address book
and executes the `LocationCommand` to access the location using the address attained.

The execution of LocationCommand is processed in this way:

. User will input `locate index` where `index` refers to the index of the person listed in the `PersonListPanel` in GUI.
. Input of user will be parse as an argument through the AddressBookParser and LocationCommandParser to extract the index.
. A new `LocationCommand` with the index inputted will be created.
. The method `execute()` of the `LocationCommand` will then be processed,
 where the person of the address that the user wants to find on Google Maps Search will be obtained through the
 index of the `lastShownList` and stored into `person` variable which is of `ReadOnlyPerson` data-type.
. The `EventsCenter` will then post a new `AccessLocationRequestEvent` with parameter input of the `address` of the `person` variable.
. The `AccessLocationRequestEvent` event would then be handled by an event handler `handleAccessLocationEvent` in `BrowserPanel`.
. The event handler will help to load the address of the person through Google Maps Search in the browser panel.

Code of `LocationCommand` and its method `execute()`:
[source,java]
----
public class LocationCommand extends Command {
    private final Index targetIndex;

    // ... LocationCommand logic ...

    public LocationCommand(Index targetIndex) {
        this.targetIndex = targetIndex;
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyPerson person = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        String name = person.getName().toString();
        String location = person.getAddress().toString();
        if (location.equals("NIL")) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_LOCATION);
        }

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new AccessLocationRequestEvent(location));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_LOCATE_PERSON_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased(), name));
    }
}
----

Code of how accessing location event is handled in `BrowserPanel`:
[source,java]
----
public class BrowserPanel extends UiPart<Region> {

    public static final String GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL_PREFIX = "https://www.google.com.sg/maps?safe=off&q=";
    public static final String GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL_SUFFIX = "&cad=h";

    // ... BrowserPanel logic ...

    private void loadPersonLocation(String location) {
        loadPage(GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL_PREFIX + location.replaceAll(" ", "+")
                + GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL_SUFFIX);
    }

    public void loadPage(String url) {
        Platform.runLater(() -> browser.getEngine().load(url));
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleAccessLocationEvent(AccessLocationRequestEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadPersonLocation(event.location);
    }
}
----

Through the sequence diagram, you can see how the code executes when a user
inputs `locate 1` into the command line.

When a user inputs `locate 1`, it will trigger `LogicManager` to parse the arguments
into the `AddressBookParser` so that it can create a new `LocationCommand` and store it as a `Command`.

Sequence diagram for `Logic` Component for `LocationCommand` and how it is executed:

image::LocationCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.9.1 LocationCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

After creating a new `LocationCommand`, `LogicManager` will call execute on `LocationCommand`
and this will result in the address of the person at the index inputted to be attained through
the `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` of the `ModelManager`.
The address attained will be parsed through an event request and event handler.
Finally, the address will then be loaded onto Google Maps Search of the browser of the `MainWindow`.

The process can be observed in the sequence diagram below
where it shows the sequence of `execute()` method of `LocationCommand` and its event handling.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How accessing a location of a person executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new event request and event handler for LocationCommand. +
**Pros:** Able to have more features like Location, AccessWebsite and Select feature that is able to exist concurrently in the application. +
**Cons:** Having the current select feature which is to search for names of contact of Google is quite unnecessary. +
**Alternative 2:** Change the code of event request and event handler related to SelectCommand to allow users to access the address through Google Maps Search instead
of processing a search on contact's name through the google search using browser. +
**Pros:** Select feature which seems unnecessary is replaced with a more useful feature of AccessWebsite. +
**Cons:** Will not be able to replace the select feature anymore which might be important for other aspects such as creating a PersonCard Viewer
which is important for GUI enhancement. +

//end::locate[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism
The find mechanism is facilitated by the `NameContainsKeyWordsPredicate` class which resides in the person class. It supports finding any person in the address book using their full name or a part of the name.

However, if a user is searching by part of a name, the substring must be in the beginning of the first name or last name and it has to be at least two characters long.

The `find` command is not an undoable command and therefore it inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`.

The `NameContainsKeyWordsPredicate` class has a test function that uses stream, a new feature of Java 8 to process data more efficiently than using loops. The `test()` returns true if either the full name(first name + last name) ignoring case or it contains a substring of the name ignoring case.

The main logic in the `NameContainsKeyWordsPredicate` class comes from the `StringUtil` class that acts as a helper function for handling any operations related to strings.

How the `containsPartofWord()` function works:
[source,java]
----
public static boolean containsPartOfWord(String sentence, String word) {
    requireNonNull(sentence);
    requireNonNull(word);
    ...
}
----

The function takes in two string arguments, one being the name of the person and the other being the substring. The function first checks to see if either of these arguments are null using java.util.Objects.requireNonNull. If any of the arguments are null, it throws a NullPointerException.
[source,java]
----
public static boolean containsPartOfWord(String sentence, String word) {
    ....
    checkArgument(preppedWord.split("\\s+").length == 1, "Word parameter should be a single word");
    String preppedSentence = sentence;
    String[] wordsInPreppedSentence = preppedSentence.split("\\s+");
    ...
}
----

If both strings are valid, it then checks that the substring is only one word. The function then splits up the person’s name into first name and last name.
[source,java]
----
public static boolean containsPartOfWord(String sentence, String word) {
    ....
    if (preppedWord.length() >= 2) {
        for (String wordInSentence : wordsInPreppedSentence) {
            if ((wordInSentence.toLowerCase().contains(preppedWord.toLowerCase()))
                && (wordInSentence.toLowerCase().startsWith(preppedWord.toLowerCase()))) {
            return true;
            }
        }
    ....
----
The function first checks if the length of the substring is greater than, equal to 2. Using an enhanced for loop, the function iterates through the words in a person’s name and checks to see if any of them start with the substring ignoring cases.

If yes, then the function returns true else it returns false.

=== Find Tag mechanism

The find tag mechanism is facilitated by `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`, a predicate class that finds persons in the address book with the tag specified by the user.
It lists out all contacts that have the specified tag. Contacts with substrings of the tag will not be listed, unlike the Find mechanism. This command will inherit from `Command`.

From Figure 5.11.1 below, the `FindTagCommand` inherits from `Command`, which means its state is not saved by the address book, and it cannot be undone after executing the command.

image::FindTagCommandDiagram1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.11.1 FindTagCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of FindTagCommand is processed in this way:

. User will execute `findtag classmates` to find contacts in The Myth's Book with the tag `classmates`.

. The execution of `findtag classmates` updates the `PersonList` in `AddressBook` with `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`, which checks if the contacts in `PersonList` have the tag `classmates`.

Code of `FindTagCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public class FindTagCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... find tag logic ...
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate);
    }
}
----

Code of `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`:
[source,java]
----
public class TagContainsKeywordsPredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        return (keywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase
                (person.getTagsText(), keyword)));
    }
}
----

The follow sequence diagram shows how the find tag operation works:

As seen in Figure 5.11.2, when `findtag classmates` is typed into the command line input, a new `FindTagCommand` is created.

_Figure 5.11.2 FindTagCommand Logic Sequence Diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Tag of contacts has to match with the tag specified by the user +
**Pros:** Persons found are specific to the tags that the user wants to find. Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** `FindTagcommand` cannot account for mistypes or account for cases where users can't remember the exact tag for his/her contacts. +
**Alternative 2:** Substrings of the tag of contacts can be matched as well +
**Pros:** `FindTagCommand` can account for cases where users do not remember the exact tag for his/her contacts. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement. Not exactly a big improvement to `FindTagCommand`. +

=== Favourite/Unfavourite mechanism

The favourite/unfavourite mechanism is facilitated by the `Favourite` field that resides in `Person`. These commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

As seen in the diagram below,`FavouriteCommand` and `UnfavouriteCommand` inherits `UndoableCommand`, which is an extra layer between abstract Command class and concrete commands that can be undone. When `FavouriteCommand` or `UnfavouriteCommand` is executed,
the previous state of the address book before favouriting or unfavouriting a person is saved.

image::FavouriteCommandDiagram1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.12.1 FavouriteCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of FavouriteCommand is processed in this way:

. User will execute `list` to view the list of persons in The Myth's Book.

. User will then execute `favourite 1`, with `1` being the `index` of the person that the user wants to favourite, provided by the executed `list`.

. The `PersonList` in `AddressBook` will then favourite the person specified by the user's execution of `favourite 1`.

. The `PersonCard` will be notified through `BindListeners` that the person specified is favourited, and will set the favourite icon beside the person's name.

The execution of UnfavouriteCommand is processed similarly, but the person will be unfavourited, and the favourite icon will be removed instead.
The execution of UnfavouriteCommand will also enable the display of `FavouriteList`.

Code of `FavouriteCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public class FavouriteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... favourite logic ...

        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        ReadOnlyPerson personToFavourite = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

        model.favouritePerson(personToFavourite);
    }
}
----

Code of `UnfavouriteCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public class UnfavouriteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... unfavourite logic ...

        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        ReadOnlyPerson personToUnfavourite = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

        model.unfavouritePerson(personToUnfavourite);
    }
}
----

Favouriting/Unfavouriting of person in AddressBook.java:
[source,java]
----
public void favouritePerson(ReadOnlyPerson target) throws PersonNotFoundException {
    persons.favouritePerson(target);
}

public void unfavouritePerson(ReadOnlyPerson target) throws PersonNotFoundException {
    persons.unfavouritePerson(target);
}
----

Listener for change of favourite field in PersonCard.java:
[source,java]
----
private void bindListeners(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    // ... listeners logic for other fields ...
    person.favouriteProperty().addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -> {
        initFavourite(person);
    });
}
----

Setting visibility of favourite icon beside name in PersonCard.java:
[source,java]
----
private void initFavourite(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    if (person.isFavourite()) {
        favouriteImage.setVisible(true);
    } else {
        favouriteImage.setVisible(false);
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the favourite/unfavourite operation works:

As seen in the diagram below, when `favourite 1` is typed into the command line input, a new `FavouriteCommand` is created.
The same works for `UnfavouriteCommand` when `unfavourite 1` is typed into the command line input.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `FavouriteCommand` and `UnfavouriteCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extending to `UndoableCommand` class. +
**Pros:** Better for users to undo `FavouriteCommand` or `UnfavouriteCommand` if he/she favourites/unfavourites the wrong person. +
**Cons:** Developers need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand`. +
**Alternative 2:** Extending to `Command` class. +
**Pros:** Developers do not need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand` class. +
**Cons:** `FavouriteCommand` cannot be undone and have to call `UnfavouriteCommand` or vice versa to undo mistyped command +

=== Favourite List mechanism

The favourite list mechanism is facilitated by `NameContainsFavouritePredicate`, a predicate class that checks if a person is favourited. It lists out all contacts that are favourited. This command will inherit from `Command`.

As seen in the diagram below, `FavouriteListCommand` inherits from `Command`, which means its state is not saved by the address book, and it cannot be undone after executing the command.

image::FavouriteListCommandDiagram1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.13.1 FavouriteListCommand Logic Class Diagram_

The execution of `FavouriteListCommand` is processed in this way:

. User will execute `favourites` to display a list of favourited persons in The Myth's Book.

. The execution of `favourites` updates the `PersonList` in `AddressBook` with `NameContainsFavouritePredicate`, which checks if a person is favourited.

Code of `FavouriteListCommand`:
[source,java]
----
public class FavouriteListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... favourite list logic ...
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate);
    }
}
----

Code of `NameContainsFavouritePredicate`:
[source,java]
----
public class NameContainsFavouritePredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        return person.getFavourite();
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the favourite list operation works:

As seen in Figure 5.13.2, when `favourites` is typed into the command line input, a new `FavouriteListCommand` is created.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `FavouriteListCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extends to `Command` +
**Pros:** Developers do not need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand` class. +
**Cons:** Users may want to undo `FavouriteListCommand` as they may not have wanted to list the favourited persons. +
**Alternative 2:** Extends to `UndoableCommand` +
**Pros:** Users can undo `FavouriteListCommand` when they mistype the command. +
**Cons:** Developers need to learn the implementation of `UndoableCommand`. Unnecessary to extend to `UndoableCommand` since users can type `ListCommand` to go back to the list of all persons. +
// end::favouriteunfavourite[]

//tag::birthday[]
=== Birthdays mechanism
The Birthdays mechanism is facilitated by the `CheckIfBirthday` class which resides in the person class. It lists out all contacts that have their birthdays today.

The `Birthdays` command is not an undoable command and thus inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`.

The `CheckIfBirthday` class checks if the birth month and day of a contact matches today. As the birthday field is a birthday object, it is converted to a string using the `toString()` method in the `Birthday` class and then parsed into a date object using `simpleDateFormat()`.
[source,java]
----
 Date date = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy").parse(birthday);
----

The date is then converted into a `Calendar` object for easier comparison. Then the Day and Month of today is compared with the day and month of a person's birthday in the following way.
[source,java]
----
return (((cal.get(Calendar.MONTH)) == Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.MONTH))
                && ((cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) == Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH))));
    }
----

An overall view of birthdays command logic is shown in Figure 5.14.1:

image::BirthdayMechanism.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.14.1 Birthdays Command Logic Sequence Diagram_

What the user finally sees is a list of people with their birthday today. This is because the `executeUndoableCommand()` which is overriden in the BirthdaysCommand class updates the `filteredPersonList`.
[source,java]
----
 @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(check);
        return new CommandResult(getBirthdayMessageSummary(model.getFilteredPersonList().size()));
    }
----

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** UI of `BirthdaysCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Showing the persons as a list. +
**Pros:** g: Voluntary action. users can check birthday if they want to and won't get confused even if there are multiple contacts with the same name as to whose birthday it is. +
**Cons:** Some users might want the birthdays to appear as a pop up. +
**Alternative 2:** Use a pop up which is triggered when the app is opened. +
**Pros:** Involuntary and less effort from the users' part. +
**Cons:** If pop up only shows a list of names, users might get confused as to who the person is if there are multiple persons with the same name. +

// tag::modeswitch[]
=== Mode Switching mechanism

This mechanism allows the switching between `two` modes in The Myth's Book which is firstly, `Persons Mode` which is activated by typing `list`,
and secondly, `Events Mode` which is activated by typing `events`. The mode switching mechanism allows users to type in different specific commands based on the mode
that is being used in the software.

The commands are categorised into three groups:

* `Person Commands` such as the `AddCommand` or `EditCommand`.
* `Event Commands` such as the `AddEventCommand` or `DeleteEventCommand`.
* `General Commands` such as the `HelpCommand` or `SwitchThemeCommand`.

The `Person Commands` and `Event Commands` commands are controlled by a boolean variable `personListActivated`
which is initially set as true
where system is in `Persons Mode` at the start. +
The `General Commands` is not controlled by the boolean variable `personListActivated` and is able to be executed in both modes.
`Person Commands` can be used when `personListActivated` is `true` while `Event Commands` can be used when `personListActivated` is `false`.

The implementation of the mode switching mechanism is mostly done in the `Logic` component.
The Mode Switching Mechanism is implemented in the `AddressBookParser` code of the `Logic` component.

Suppose a user is currently on the `Persons Mode` on The Myth's Book and he wants to use
the `Events Mode` and the commands related to `Events`. As such, user is currently able to
use `Person Commands` and `General Commands` but unable to use `Event Commands`.

The execution of Mode Switching Mechanism from `Persons Mode` to `Events Mode` processed in this way:

. User wants to add a new event so user inputs `addevent n/ZoukOut d/5/12/2017 a/Sentosa Beach, Siloso`.
. Input of user is parse as an argument through the `AddressBookParser` but throws an error as application is not in the `Events Mode`.
. User then switches to `Events Mode` by inputting `events` which would turn `personListActivated` to `false`.
. User is now able to use `Event Commands` such as the `AddEventCommand` or `DeleteEventCommand`.
. User then uses the `AddEventCommand` and inputs `addevent n/ZoukOut d/5/12/2017 a/Sentosa Beach, Siloso`.
. Input of user is successfully parse as an argument through the `AddressBookParser` and then through the `AddEventCommandParser` and adds a new event successfully.

Suppose a user is currently on the `Events Mode` and wants to use the `Persons Mode` and the commands related to `Persons`.

In order for user to switch back from `Events Mode` to `Persons Mode`:

. User wants to add a new contact so user inputs `add n/Dion Poh p/63425234 e/dionPoh@hotmail.com`.
. User switches to `Persons Mode` by inputting `list` which would turn `personListActivated` to `true`.
. User is now able to use `Person Commands` such as the `AddCommand`.
. User then uses the `AddCommand` and inputs `add n/Dion Poh p/63425234 e/dionPoh@hotmail.com`.
. Input of user is successfully parse as an argument through the `AddressBookParser` and then through the `AddCommandParser` and adds a new contact successfully.


Code of `AddressBookParser` class and how it executes:
[source,java]
----
public class AddressBookParser {

    /**
     * Used to control lock mechanism for different commands between person and events platforms.
     */
    private static Boolean personListActivated = true;

    // ... AddressBookParser logic ...

    public Command parseCommand(String userInput) throws ParseException {
        // ... parseCommand logic ...

        switch (commandWord) {
        case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD: case AddCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            if (personListActivated) {
                return new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments);
            } else {
                throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_PLATFORM);
            }

        // ... other code ...

        case ListCommand.COMMAND_WORD: case ListCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            personListActivated = true;
            return new ListCommand();

        // ... other code ...

        case HelpCommand.COMMAND_WORD: case HelpCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new HelpCommand();

        case AddEventCommand.COMMAND_WORD: case AddEventCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            if (!personListActivated) {
                return new AddEventCommandParser().parse(arguments);
            } else {
                throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_INVALID_EVENT_PLATFORM);
            }

        case EventsCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
            personListActivated = false;
            return new EventsCommand();

        // ... other code ...
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** The handling of different commands inputted into CommandBox for the two different modes(Persons or Events) in The Myth's Book.  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a system in the AddressBookParser that can differentiate the different commands for different modes(Persons or Events). +
**Pros:** Able to have better usability as it can separate and classify features for both Persons and Events that is able to exist concurrently with lesser bugs in the application. +
**Cons:** Users would have to switch between Events and Persons platform when they want to use the other platform that they are not currently on. +
**Alternative 2:** Use the initial AddressBookParser given that accepts all of command and still executes regardless of the software being used in either mode. +
**Pros:** User can use all commands and does not need to face the issue of having to switch between the two platforms to use the different commands. +
**Cons:** User experience and software might feel buggy as user might be on the events mode but executing commands related to the persons mode which user might be unable to see. +

//tag::optionalfield[]
===  Optional Person Fields mechanism

This mechanism allows certain fields of the `Person` class to be optional when adding a contact.
The implementation of making fields optional for `AddCommand` allows users to add contacts with lesser
information required as it only requires name,phone,email to add a contact and other fields can be
optionally added together into the input of adding a contact. The implementation is mostly done in the`Model` and `Logic` component.

Suppose a user would like to add a new contact with an address to The Myth's Book and executes the `AddCommand`
by typing `add n/Adam Bait e/adambait@example.com p/98123414 a/18 Taiseng`.

The execution of `AddCommand` is processed in this way:

. User will input `add n/Adam Bait e/adambait@example.com p/98123414 a/18 Taiseng`.
. Input of user will be handled by the `LogicManager` and parse as an argument through the `AddressBookParser` and `AddCommandParser`.
. `AddCommandParser` will check for all the prefixes inputted and the existence of compulsory prefixes required.
. As `Name`,`Phone`,`Email` fields are necessary fields, they are handled as per normal in the `parse` method of `AddCommandParser`
after being checked that the user has inputted the correct prefixes and information for the 3 necessary fields.
. For the `Address` field which are similar to other optional fields, it tests whether user has inputted
the address field or not in `parse` method of `AddCommandParser` and `parseAddress` method of `ParserUtil.java`.
. Based on whether the user has inputted the optional `Address` field, it is handled either by
assigning it with the inputted and validated string of address or assigning it with a
temporary string variable as seen from `Address` constructor of `Address.java`.
. Once all information inputted is handled, user's inputted contact will be successfully added into The Myth's Book.

Code of `parse` method inside `AddCommandParser.java`:

        return new AddCommand(person);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
    }

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** The ease of adding contacts to The Myth's Book.  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make certain fields that are supposed to be inputted to be optional. +
**Pros:** Users are able to add contacts without much trouble as it only requires minimally 3 inputs. +
**Cons:** Users would not have full details of a contact that is being added if all fields are not filled in. +
**Alternative 2:** All fields must be inputted in order for users to add a contact. +
**Pros:** When a contact is added, all information related to the contact is accounted for. +
**Cons:** As there are currently 8-9 fields that are required to fill in, it might be realistically troublesome for a user
to add a contact which is not user friendly. +

=== Calendar mechanism

==== Creating Calendar Layout

The Calendar is created with GridPanes and VBox. The following code snippets describes how the `AnchorPaneNode` object fills up the
GridPane of the calendar. At the end of the method, the VBox gathers all the required parameters to get the view of the calendar.

[source,java]
----
    public Calendar(YearMonth yearMonth, ObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent> eventList) {
        currentYearMonth = yearMonth;
        // Create the calendar grid pane
        GridPane calendar = new GridPane();
        calendar.setPrefSize(600, 400);
        // Create rows and columns with anchor panes for the calendar
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
                AnchorPaneNode ap = new AnchorPaneNode();
                ap.setPrefSize(200, 200);
                calendar.add(ap, j, i);
                allCalendarDays.add(ap);
                ap.getStyleClass().add("calendar-color");
            }
        }

        // Days of the week labels
        Text[] dayNames = new Text[]{new Text("Sunday"), new Text("Monday"),
                          new Text("Tuesday"), new Text("Wednesday"), new Text("Thursday"),
                          new Text("Friday"), new Text("Saturday")};

        GridPane dayLabels = new GridPane();
        dayLabels.setPrefWidth(600);
        Integer col = 0;
        for (Text txt : dayNames) {
            txt.getStyleClass().add("calendar-color");
            AnchorPane ap = new AnchorPane();
            ap.setPrefSize(200, 10);
            ap.setBottomAnchor(txt, 5.0);
            ap.getChildren().add(txt);
            dayLabels.add(ap, col++, 0);
        }
        ...
    }
----

==== Populating Calendar

Now, you have the Calendar outline, the populateCalendar method calendar called will then populate the Calendar with the individual dates of the months.
During the process, we would check if is there any events that are on the date corresponding to the AnchorPaneNode. If it tallies, the AnchorPaneNode will
be populated with a change in background color.

[source,java]
----
    public void populateCalendar(YearMonth yearMonth, ObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent> events) {
        // Get the date we want to start with on the calendar
        LocalDate calendarDate = LocalDate.of(yearMonth.getYear(), yearMonth.getMonthValue(), 1);
        // Dial back the day until it is SUNDAY (unless the month starts on a sunday)
        while (!calendarDate.getDayOfWeek().toString().equals("SUNDAY")) {
            calendarDate = calendarDate.minusDays(1);
        }
        // Populate the calendar with day numbers
        for (AnchorPaneNode ap : allCalendarDays) {
            if (ap.getChildren().size() != 0) {
                ap.getChildren().remove(0);
            }
            Text txt = new Text(String.valueOf(calendarDate.getDayOfMonth()));
            txt.getStyleClass().add("calendar-color");
            ap.setDate(calendarDate);
            ap.setTopAnchor(txt, 5.0);
            ap.setLeftAnchor(txt, 5.0);
            ap.setStyle("-fx-background-color: transparent;");
            ap.getChildren().add(txt);
            calendarDate = calendarDate.plusDays(1);
        }

        for (AnchorPaneNode ap : allCalendarDays) {

https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/AnchorPaneNode.java[AnchorPaneNode]

The updating of different months and population of event nodes are done by the two separate methods that will post events to
`EventsCenter` to update the calendar based on the `currentYearMonth`. The listener `handlePopulateMonthEvent` method
will then populate the Calendar in `MainWindow` with `EventList`.

----
    public void previousMonth() {
        currentYearMonth = currentYearMonth.minusMonths(1);
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new PopulateMonthEvent(currentYearMonth));
    }
    public void nextMonth() {
        currentYearMonth = currentYearMonth.plusMonths(1);
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new PopulateMonthEvent(currentYearMonth));
    }
----

----
    @Subscribe
    private void handlePopulateMonthEvent(PopulateMonthEvent request) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(request));
        calendar.populateCalendar(request.yearMonth, logic.getFilteredEventList());
    }
----

==== Dialog Box

The mechanism behind the process of adding an event from the dialog box is shown in Figure 5.17.3.1 below.

image::dialogaddeventsequencediagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 5.17.3.1 Dialog Add Event Model, EventsCenter & UI Sequence Diagram_

From the startDialog method in `AnchorPaneNode` class, after receiving a valid Event, an `AddEventRequestEvent` object will be posted to `EventsCenter`.
Then with the `@Subscribe` function, a handleAddEvent() method in `ModelManager` will be called to addEvent of the `AddressBook` object. The following code snippets
shows the key implementation of how an Event object is added to the addressbook.

[source,java]
----
   dialog.setResultConverter(dialogButton -> {
        if (dialogButton == button) {
                return new BuildEvent().withName(text1.getText())
                                       .withDate(date).withAddress(text2.getText()).build();
            }
            return null;
        });

        Optional<Event> result = dialog.showAndWait();
        result.ifPresent(event -> {
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new AddEventRequestEvent(event));
   });
----

[source,java]
----
    @Subscribe
    private void handleAddEvent(AddEventRequestEvent event) throws DuplicateEventException {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        addressBook.addEvent(event.event);
        updateFilteredEventList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
    }
----

Population of the calendar after Adding or Delete of Events will be completed by this method in the `Calendar.java` class.
It reverts every node to be of the same color, then runs through the events list to update the individual event node.

[source,java]
----
    public void populateUpdatedCalendar(UniqueEventList eventList) {
        for (AnchorPaneNode ap : allCalendarDays) {
            ap.setStyle("-fx-background-color: transparent;");
            for (Event event1 : eventList) {
                DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("d/MM/yyyy");
                String newDate = formatter.format(ap.getDate());
                if (newDate.equals(event1.getDate().toString())) {
                    ap.getChildren();
                    ap.setStyle("-fx-background-color: #ffebcd;");
                }
            }
        }
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** UI of `Calendar` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Showing the calendar on a GridPane +
**Pros:** A customizable calendar for the user and easy access to add an event on the calendar  +
**Cons:** Some users might want to have better user interface experience +
**Alternative 2:** Google calendar implementation +
**Pros:** Ready made calendar for developers to implement +
**Cons:** Difficult to apply changes and suit the calendar to be as what user wants. +

//end::calendar[]

//tag::details[]
=== Details Panel Mechanism
The details panel is used to show all the information regarding a person as compared to the person card which shows only a person's name, tags, phone number and email id.

The details panel can be accessed by using the `select` command or by directly clicking on the peron card in the ui.

The  panel is directly accessed by `MainWindow` class. The `details panel` class extends from `UiPart<Region>` and calls the super class constructor to use the FXML file.

It also calls the `loadBlankPage()` method in its constructor so that the user does not see anything on the details panel when the application is first opened.

The `loadPersonInfo()` method is called from  two event handlers `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent()` and `handlePersonSelectionChangedEvent()` as shown in the code snippet below.
[source,java]
----
 @Subscribe
    private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadPersonInfo(event.getNewSelection().person);
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handlePersonSelectionChangedEvent(PersonSelectionChangedEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadPersonInfo(event.getNewSelection());
    }

----

The `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is used to load a person's details only when a person card has been selected and a personPanelSelectionChangedEvent is raised. The PersonSelectionchangedEvent is raised when the person's details are updated using the `edit` command.

The `loadPersonInfo` is facilitated by the `bindListeners()` method that "listens" for a change in any of the fields of the person.

The sequence diagram is shown in 5.18.1 below.

image::DetailsPanelMechanism.png[width="800"]
Figure 5.18.1 Details Panel Sequence Diagram

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Creating the details panel when there is a person card. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** details panel
**Pros:** g: Offers more abstraction to the user as they only see necessary information on the person card and the rest is on the details panel. +
**Cons:** Some users might find it a hassle to access the details panel to see more information. +
**Alternative 2:** All the information on the person card. +
**Pros:** Users will have all the information in one place. +
**Cons:** Some fields are optional so the person card will look confusing to a new user if they see that some person cards have more information on them than the others. +
//end::details[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

link:#the-myths-book---developer-guide[Back To Top]

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
