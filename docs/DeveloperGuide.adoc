== Introduction

link:#rolodex[Rolodex] is a desktop contact management application for users who prefer working without a mouse to manage their contacts more efficiently.
It is useful for busy people who have many connections, such as a businessmen with a list of clients to remember, or a teacher who wants to organize their student information.

The Developer Guide will walk you through the design, implementation and development environment of link:#rolodex[Rolodex]. This is the go-to page for all your information needs in understanding our application.

== Setting Up

This section will guide you in setting up the Rolodex project in your local machine for the first time.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any link:#java[Java 8] version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of link:#java[Java 8].
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and link:#java-fx[JavaFx] plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the Project in Your Computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the Setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to Do Before Writing Code

Before you start coding, there are some important configurations that you have to do for the project to run smoothly.

==== Configuring the Coding Style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Configuring Rolodex `.rldx` Extensions

link:#rolodex[Rolodex] files are associated with the `.rldx` extensions and are an extension of xml. To configure xml tools in intellij for `rldx` files,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `File Types`
. Under `Recognized File Types`, highlight the `XML` option
. In the lower tab under registered patterns, click `+` on the side. A new prompt should appear as seen in the picture below
. Enter `.rldx` and click `ok`, then click `apply`

image::RegisterRldx.png[width="600"]

If you can get syntax highlighting as seen below, you are successfully configured to use `.rldx` files with intellij.

image::RldxSyntaxHighlighting.png[width="600"]

==== Updating Documentation to Match Your Fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform link:#continuous-integration[Continuous Integration (CI)] for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting Started With Coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

To help you better understand the internal design of the application, this section provides model diagrams with accompanying explanations
for the main architecture of Rolodex.

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven Nature of the Design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `RolodexChangedEvent` when the link:#rolodex[Rolodex] data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI Component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses link:#java-fx[JavaFx] UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic Component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `RolodexParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model Component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the link:#rolodex[Rolodex] data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage Component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the link:#rolodex[Rolodex] data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the link:#rolodex[rolodex] (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the link:#rolodex[rolodex] before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the rolodex. The current state of the rolodex is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the rolodex to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the rolodex to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire rolodex. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the rolodex (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the rolodex and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::openNew[]
=== Open File and New File Mechanism
The open new file and creating new file mechanism are handled by two new types of requests under the `EventsCenter`,
`OpenRolodexRequestEvent` and `RolodexChangedDirectoryEvent`. Upon receiving a new command, the `MainApp` attempts to
reloads the instance `model` and `logic` but **not the `UI`**.

The high level sequence diagram for a typical `open` request can be seen below:

image::OpenNewHighLevelSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. A user requests to open `data/default.rldx`.
2. The command is handled the same way as other commands, by the parser in
logic, then via the `OpenCommand` object itself, under the `Logic` component of the application.
3. Upon a successful parsing of the command and execution, the command would raise a new `OpenRolodexRequestEvent` to
be handled by the `EventsCenter`.
4. The `EventsCenter` posts a new `OpenRolodexRequestEvent` back to the `MainApp` where the new Rolodex path would be
loaded with the successfully read data from the file path specified:
* The preferences file of the user specified under `config.json` would now point to the latest active directory.
* The `storage`, `model` and `logic` instances of the `MainApp` would be now loaded with data from the new active directory.

The behaviour of the `save` operation remains unchanged, to be handled under the `RolodexChangedEvent`.
The Rolodex only writes to the active database upon an editor command (e.g. `add`, `edit`).
The `UI` however, is updated as seen in the following sequence diagram:

image::OpenNewRolodexChangedLocationEventSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. Upon successful handling of a `OpenRolodexRequestEvent`, `MainApp` raises a new `RolodexChangedDirectoryEvent`.
2. The event is then reposted by the `EventsCenter`.
3. The `MainWindow` of the `UI` instance consumes the event and updates the status bar with the new active filepath.

The `New` command only differs from the sequence of the open new Rolodex by being executed when no valid file exists at
the specified active directory:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    if (new File(filePath).exists()) {
        throw  new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_ALREADY_EXISTS, filePath));
    } else {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new OpenRolodexRequestEvent(filePath));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_CREATING, filePath));
    }
}
----

In contrast, the `Open` command is a reverse of the above:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    if (new File(filePath).exists()) {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new OpenRolodexRequestEvent(filePath));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_OPENING, filePath));
    } else {
        throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_NOT_EXIST, filePath));
    }
}
----


[NOTE]
The `XmlRolodexStorage.java` now only saves upon recognizing that the current file has a `.rldx` extension, which is a
subset of xml for the Rolodex application, as seen in the snippet below:

[source,java]
----
public void saveRolodex(ReadOnlyRolodex rolodex, String filePath) throws IOException {
    ...
    if (!isValidRolodexStorageExtension(filePath)) {
        throw new InvalidExtensionException(
                String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_EXTENSION_FORMAT, ROLODEX_FILE_EXTENSION));
    }
    ...
}
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** General Implementation +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reload the current `MainApp` with the new database. +
**Pros:** The application can be quickly reloaded onto the active window. +
**Cons:** User might need to switch back and forth between the Rolodex directories. +
**Alternative 2:** Reload `MainApp` with a new application instance. +
**Constraint:** link:#java-fx[JavaFX] only allows launch(args) to be launched once per execution time on a code level.
Another approach would be to reload the application with a loaded and built .jar. +
**Pros:** Easier logic to understand for new developers. +
**Cons:** Building and debugging with a second .jar will be confusing and problematic to any development workflow. +
**Alternative 3:** Open a new window with the loaded data. +
**Pros:** The user can continue to operate on the previous Rolodex application. +
**Cons:** The developer would have to spend time configuring different `EventsCenter` posts for the different application windows.

---

**Aspect:** Saving only to files with `.rldx` extensions +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Write to the active directory only if it has a `.rldx` extension. +
**Pros:** The application control becomes stricter, preventing users from writing to a file with say a `.png` extension. +
**Cons:** Extensions become forced even for valid databases with `.xml` file types. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow writable to all file extensions. +
**Pros:** Users can have more freedom in choice of file naming. +
**Cons:** If the user accidentally writes to a file that is not a valid database, the user would corrupt the file data.

---

**Aspect:** Separating `open` and `new` commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Two commands, one for opening existing files and one for creating new files. +
**Pros:** The user can easily be notified if a file exists or if it has been moved. +
**Cons:** The user would have to take note of two commands instead of one. +

// end::openNew[]

// tag::findClose[]
=== Fuzzy Finding Mechanism
The link:#fuzzy-finding[fuzzy finding] mechanism is powered by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance[Levenshtein distance],
a string heuristic for measuring the difference between two character sequences. It can be informally viewed as the number
of _hops_ that are required to get from a string to another, where _hops_ are insertions, deletions and substitution
operations.

The activity diagram for the link:#fuzzy-finding[fuzzy finding] can be loosely described as seen in the figure below:

image::FuzzyFindActivityDiagram.png[]

1. A user sends a find request
2. Application looks at all contacts currently in the database
3. If the search parameters loosely match any of the name words of the current contact, add it into the list view.
4. Otherwise, if it is an exact match on any of the name words of the current contact, add it into the list view.
5. Otherwise, if it matches any other conditions specified under the find command, add it into the list view.

[NOTE]
If a contact's name word has a shorter length than the specified global minimum, the condition automatically triggers to false
and starts searching for exact matches.

The settings for the loose matching can be found as a static constant of the Person class.

[source,java]
----
public class Person implements ReadOnlyPerson {
    private static final int FIND_NAME_GLOBAL_TOLERANCE = 4;
    private static final int FIND_NAME_DISTANCE_TOLERANCE = 2;
    ...
}
----

`FIND_NAME_GLOBAL_TOLERANCE` is the global minimum distance of the currently examined name word for the loose matching to execute.
`FIND_NAME_DISTANCE_TOLERANCE` is the maximum levenshtein distance from the currently examined search parameter
to the currently examined name word in which the contact will be added.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Length of name word +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a global minimum for defining when the link:#fuzzy-finding[fuzzy finding] should execute. +
**Pros:** Name words have higher minimum hop to length ratio. +
**Cons:** User might need link:#fuzzy-finding[fuzzy finding] on name words with character length lesser than the global minimum. +
**Pros:** Easy logic to understand, implement and maintain. +
**Cons:** Rudimentary algorithm.

---

**Aspect:** Location of fuzzy find settings +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use private static constant in a person. +
**Pros:** User does not need to worry about changing the settings or the intricacies of the link:#fuzzy-finding[fuzzy finding]. +
**Cons:** User might need stricter or looser limits than the ones defined for them. +
**Pros:** Developers can easily change and manage settings and limits. +
**Cons:** Users have no way of accessing the settings and limits. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow user to set fuzzy find settings in a document file. +
**Pros:** Advanced users can change the settings to suit their needs better. +
**Cons:** Developers need to spend more work maintaining more components including storage.
// end::findClose[]

// tag::sorting[]
=== Sorting Mechanism
The sorting mechanism is integrated into the `list` and `find` commands which resides in the application's `logic` component.
It supports sorting in ascending or descending order of most fields of a person (e.g. [underline]#Name#, [underline]#Phone#).
The sort commands update the state of the application at the model level, which resides in `ModelManager`,
via the method `updateSortComparator`.

The activity diagram for a sort can be loosely described as seen in the figure below:

image::SortingActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Sort arguments are case-sensitive.

The case for a list command:

1. A user executes a `list` command with sort arguments.
2. The application checks for invalid sort arguments.
3. The application model creates a comparator using the sort arguments, in order.
4. The application displays the results in the specified sort order.

The case for a find command:

1. A user executes a `find` command.
2. The application separates the command arguments into find data arguments and sort arguments.
3. The application executes a search on the find arguments.
4. The application model creates a comparator using the sort arguments, in order.
5. The application displays the filtered results in the specified sort order.

[NOTE]
Find cannot work on name words matching sort arguments.

The list command's `execute()` implementation before sorting implementation:
[source,java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() {
    model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

The list command's `execute()` implementation after sorting implementation:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() {
    model.updateSortComparator(sortArguments);
    model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

Notice that `model.updateSortComparator(sortArguments)` is added to the command logic. The update will give the model a
comparator before executing a sort and filter which is handled by the event consumer.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Integrating sort +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Integrate sort into existing commands. +
**Pros:** User can quickly sort and list or find the data as specified without executing another separate command. +
**Cons:** User might need to use the sort arguments for other purposes (e.g. `find n/` does not return anyone matching `n/`). +
**Pros:** Adds onto existing functionality and reduces clutter and unnecessary creation of a new command. +
**Cons:** Bad SLAP on a user level. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a new `sort` command. +
**Pros:** User can decide when to sort the current list view +
**Cons:** User needs an additional step before sorting a list.

---

**Aspect:** Resetting sort comparator on `add` commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reset the current displayed list on an `add` command. +
**Pros:** The displayed list always complies with the model comparator. +
**Cons:** User might need to continue operating on the previous listing. +
**Alternative 2:** Append added person to the current list view. +
**Pros:** Users can immediately `edit` the person using the last listing index. +
**Cons:** The displayed listing will not comply with the model comparator.

=== Abbreviation Mechanism
The ability for users to enter a variety of different words for a same command is implemented using https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html[`java.util.set`].

An example as implemented in the open command:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class OpenCommand extends Command {

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "open";
    public static final Set<String> COMMAND_WORD_ABBREVIATIONS =
            new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(COMMAND_WORD, "o", "cd", "ls", "<"));
    ...
}
----

`COMMAND_WORD_ABBREVIATIONS` is implemented using a `java.util.HashSet` which offers reasonably fast access times.

The user would be able to use a wide variety of different commands such as `o`, `cd` like on Windows cmd, `ls` on
UNIX-like systems or the loose `<` such as when you run a `java program < input > output` on a wide variety of systems.

It can easily be seen that using a set implementation, the developer would have an extremely easy time adding/ deleting
new abbreviations. A set implementation also allows an easy way of testing if there are conflicting abbreviations, by
simply permuting the `COMMAND_WORD_ABBREVIATIONS` property of all possible commands and checking if all permutations are
pairwise disjoint:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void parseAllCommandAbbreviationsAreDisjoint() {
    ArrayList<Pair<Set<String>, Set<String>>> commandAbbreviationPermutations =
            generateCommandAbbreviationPermutations(POSSIBLE_COMMAND_ABBREVIATIONS);
    for (Pair<Set<String>, Set<String>> commandAbbreviationPair : commandAbbreviationPermutations) {
        assertTrue(Collections.disjoint(commandAbbreviationPair.getKey(), commandAbbreviationPair.getValue()));
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** A https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html[Set] of strings +
**Pros:** Constant access time per command level. Improves performance and reliability significantly. +
**Pros:** Ease of testing for conflicting abbreviations, particularly where developers forget if they used a
same abbreviation for two different commands (e.g. assigning `h` to both the `history` and `help` commands). +
**Cons:** If you have a better suggestion than the above implementation, feel free to create a new issue for discussion
on https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/issues[github]. +
**Alternative 2 (previous choice):** Manually named string Constants +
**Pros:** Forces developer to be more prudent in checking through the conflicting abbreviations. +
**Cons:** Developers would have to manually check through all commands to ensure the accuracy of the abbreviations,
which is time-consuming and makes way for human errors. +
**Cons:** A switch-case for all possible commands abbreviations would perform significantly slower than direct memory
access on a java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html[`HashSet`], in the worst case.

// end::commandAbbreviations[]

// tag::auto-completion[]
=== Auto-completion Mechanism
Auto-completion mechanism is implemented in `CommandBox` class under UI component.

Auto-completion is activated when `TAB` key is pressed. This is done by adding a case in the keypress handler in `CommandBox`.
[source,java]
----
@FXML
private void handleKeyPress(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
    switch (keyEvent.getCode()) {
    case TAB:
        autocomplete(); //checkes the input and performs actions accordingly
        break;
    //other cases
    }
----

When `TAB` is pressed, the current input in the command box is checked against the list of commands.

* If the input command is a valid command that requires additional field(s), the full format of the command is displayed in the command box.
At the same time, the placeholder for the first field that the user needs to key in is selected (as shown below).

image::AutoCompletionAfterTab.png[width="450"]

* If the input is already in the required format of the add command, the `TAB` is meant to navigate to the next input field (only `add` command require multiple fields).
The current caret position is checked and used to determine the current field the user is at.
The anchor and caret positions are reset to the start and end of the next field so that the placeholder is selected (as shown below).

image::AutoCompletionNextField.png[width="450"]

Below is an activity diagram for `TAB` keypress which activates autocompletion.

image::AutoCompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** text input control +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Continue to use the original TextField +
**Pros:** External library enables bindAutocompletion for TextField (the drop down list of suggested commands that appears and updates itself as user types). +
**Pros:** Minimise changes need to be made to the original text input control structure. +
**Cons:** Text formatting is limited. All text in the TextField must have the same format. +
**Alternative 2:** Create additional TextField as user request for additional fields +
**Pros:** Allows for different formatting for different fields (Commands can have a different colour from the fields) +
**Cons:** Original structure will be disrupted. Command box will no longer be single line text input, which have consequences such as the user cannot backspace or select through the entire line.

**Aspect:** auto-completion drop-down list +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Continue to use the original TextField and use external library to bind auto-completion +
**Pros:** Easy to implement +
**Cons:** User cannot see the full format of the commands in the drop-down list +
**Alternative 2:** Use ComboBox +
**Pros:** User can see the required fields for each command in the drop-down box +
**Cons:** As user selects an option, the command is executed with the place holders, resulting in an invalid command. User has to manually select the placeholders and change accordingly.
// end::auto-completion[]

// tag::shortcut[]
=== Keyboard Shortcuts Mechanism
The keyboard shortcuts mechanism is implemented in the `KeyListener` class under the `UI` component of the application.
It listens for key presses done by the user and executes actions mapped to these key presses, or key events.
The mapping of actions to key events are found in the `KeyListenerUtil` class.

The following class diagram shows the relationship between classes concerning the keyboard shortcuts mechanism.

image::KeyListenerDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `KeyListener` requires access to the `CommandBox`, `PersonListPanel` and `ResultDisplay` for key event executions,
such as changing the focus node.

When the user launches the application, the `UiManager` calls `mainWindow.setKeyListeners()`
which creates the `KeyListener` class to handle the key events.
In `KeyListener`, the main method for handling the key events has the following code:

[source,java]
----
public void handleKeyPress() {
    mainNode.addEventFilter(KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED, event -> {
        // actions to execute key event
    });
}
----
The `mainNode` refers to the node containing the all UI components in the application,
and `addEventFilter` captures key events received by that node. The application will continue to listen
to key presses done by the user once this method is called.

NOTE: Another common method used for capturing key events is `onKeyPressed`.
In this case, `addEventFilter` is used instead as key events captured by the former will be consumed by the `TextField` used in the application.
`addEventFilter` captures the key events before they are consumed by the `TextField`.

When the user presses a key combination which matches one that is assigned, a corresponding action will be executed.
An example of such an execution is given as shown:

[source, java]
----
private void executeKeyEvents(KeyEvent keyEvent) {
	if (KEY_COMBINATION_FOCUS_PERSON_LIST.match(keyEvent)) {
		// action to focus on person list
	}
	// … more cases
}
----
Where the application focuses on the person list when the user presses a key combination that is assigned to `KEY_COMBINATION_FOCUS_PERSON_LIST`.

The mapping of `KEY_COMBINATION_FOCUS_PERSON_LIST` to a key combination can be found in the `KeyListenerUtil` class.

[source, java]
----
public class KeyListenerUtil {

    public static final KeyCombination KEY_COMBINATION_FOCUS_PERSON_LIST = KeyCombination.valueOf("Esc");
    // … more mappings
}
----
In this case, `KEY_COMBINATION_FOCUS_PERSON_LIST` is mapped to the kbd:[esc] key. As such, a user
pressing the kbd:[esc] key will result in the application focusing on the person list.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Location of `KeyCombination` constants for the `KeyListener` class +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `KeyCombination` constants are stored in a separate utility class, `KeyListenerUtil` +
**Pros:** Better modularity given that the number of constants is fairly large. +
**Cons:** The constants have to be imported to be used in the `KeyListener` class. +
**Alternative 2:** Store the constants in the `KeyListener` class itself +
**Pros:** Straightforward implementation and the constants does not have to be imported. +
**Cons:** Violates Separation of Concerns as the `KeyListener` class acts as a storage for the constants in addition to handling key events.

**Aspect:** The way commands words are executed +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pressing the shortcut automatically executes the command +
**Pros:** Execution of command is faster and more convenient for the user. +
**Cons:** User may want to check what the shortcut does before executing the command. +
**Alternative 2:** Pressing the shortcut replaces the `TextField` with the command word +
**Pros:** Allows the user to check the command before executing it. +
**Cons:**  An extra step for user to execute the command, i.e. pressing `Enter`.

// end::shortcut[]

=== Person Detail Panel

// tag::detailPanelBehavior[]

The person detail panel displays the complete information of a person that is selected.

image::detailPanel.png[width="600"]

// end::detailPanelBehavior[]

// tag::detailPanelImp[]

The behavior of the panel is mostly event-driven, where the information displayed on the panel
changes depending on various user actions, such as a person selection, editing of a person, addition of a person, etc.

For example, the sequence diagram below shows the sequence of events to update the panel display when the user edits a person
(the logic aspect of updating the person detail is omitted for brevity).

image::DetailPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The information displayed on the panel is extracted from the `ReadOnlyPerson` that is returned by the `EventsCenter`.
The details of the implementation can be seen from the following code snippet.
[source, java]
----
/**
* Shows the details of the person on the panel
*/
private void showPersonDetails(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    setAvatar(person);
    setTextFields(person);
    setTags(person);
}
----

The behavior of the panel is summarized in the table below.

[width=60%, cols="2,3"]
|===
| User Action | Panel Behavior

| Select a person | Display selected person
| Edit a person | Display newly edited person
| Add a person | Display newly added person
| Clear the list | Display empty panel
| Call undo | Display empty panel
| Call redo | Behavior as per command that is redone
| Other commands | No change in display

=== Help Window Highlighting
Rolodex uses link:#java-fx[JavaFx] version http://javafx.com/javafx/8.0.111[8.0.111], where WebView does not support
search functionality that mimics kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[F] capability of modern web browsers. As a workaround, Johann Burkard's
http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html[jQuery text highlighting]
library is being used to implement such a feature.

Users can easily find keywords by using the highlighting feature of the help window, as opposed to manually looking through the
help document for information, which can be counterproductive:

image::Highlight.png[width="800"]

The discussion for link:#java-fx[JavaFX] to implement a native search feature within WebView is ongoing and you can find it
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19418626/javafx-search-and-highlight-text-add-search-bar-for-loaded-web-page[here].

==== Removing jQuery implementation
In a future version of link:#java-fx[JavaFx] where such an implementation is no longer necessary, you may revert the changes by reverting pull request
https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/pull/99[#99] on the Rolodex repo on GitHub. You may also choose to manually do this by reverting the following code:

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF Format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

Testing ensures that our software works as expected. In Rolodex, we use several frameworks for running tests.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of Tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section contains the tools we use for software collaboration.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform link:#continuous-integration[Continuous Integration] on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Rolodex depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving Each Component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` Component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/RolodexParser.java[`RolodexParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/RolodexParser.java[`RolodexParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` Component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the rolodex.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Rolodex.java[`Rolodex`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Rolodex.java[`Rolodex`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` Component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

=== Creating a New Command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/RolodexParser.java[`RolodexParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/RolodexParserTest.java[`RolodexParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/RolodexParser.java[`RolodexParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/RolodexParserTest.java[`RolodexParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `default.rldx` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validRolodex.rldx` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
