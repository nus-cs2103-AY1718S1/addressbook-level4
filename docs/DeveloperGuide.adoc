== Introduction
Codii is an address book application specifically designed for debt collectors to manage debts and debtors efficiently. It provides the necessary tools to keep track of interests, debts and important dates such as repayment deadlines.
This developer guide provides detailed information for future contributors to improve on the current code base, testing and documentation.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

Figure 3.1.1 below explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture diagram_

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 3.1.2 below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class diagram of the `Logic` component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

Figure 3.1.3a below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 3.1.3b below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

As shown in Figure 3.2.1 below, the `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the `UI` component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

Figure 3.3.1 shows the structure of the `Logic` component, while Figure 3.3.2 shows finer  details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3.3.1.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the `Logic` component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of commands in the `Logic` component_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Figure 3.3.3 below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.3 : Sequence diagram for interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `delete 1` command_

=== Model component

Figure 3.4.1 below shows the structure of the `Model` component.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the `Model` component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the `Storage` component_

Figure 3.5.1 shows the structure of the `Storage` component.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead.

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1: Inheritance diagram for commands_

As you can see from Figure 4.1.1, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command). This is shown in Figure 4.1.2a.

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2a: Adding a new `UndoableCommand` to an `UndoRedoStack` that is empty_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person. This is shown in Figure 4.1.2b.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2b: Adding another `UndoableCommand` to `UndoRedoStack` that is not empty_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed. This is shown in Figure 4.1.2c.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2c: Undoing a command_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

Figure 4.1.2d shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2d: Sequence diagram for `Undo` command_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command. This is shown in Figure 4.1.2e.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2e: Adding a new command when `redoStack` is not empty_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution. This is shown in Figure 4.1.2f.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2f: Executing a non-undoable command_

Figure 4.1.2g below summarizes what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

_Figure 4.1.2g: `UndoRedoStack` activity diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (e.g. `add`, `clear`, `edit`) +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::borrowPaybackCommand[]
=== Borrow/payback command mechanism

The `borrow` command allows users to increase the debt of a person should he/she borrow more money. On the other hand, when a debtor repays a specified amount, the `payback` command is used to deduct that amount from his/her current debt. The `BorrowCommand` and `PaybackCommand` classes, which handle the updating of the `Debt` fields in a `Person` object, extend `UndoableCommand` so that both of these commands can be undone or redone if necessary.

These two commands require one compulsory argument which is the amount that is borrowed/paid back. Indicating the index (as listed in the person list panel on the left side of the application window) of the person who borrowed or paid back money is optional. If no index is specified, the command will be executed for the person that is currently selected in the person list.
The arguments (index and amount borrowed/paid back) are separated by a whitespace instead of special prefixes (e.g. prefix `n/` used for name). Hence, the `String#split` method is used to tokenize the input using a single whitespace as the delimiter. As seen in Figure 4.2.1, the tokenized inputs (index and amount borrowed) are then converted to their appropriate `Object` types and supplied as arguments to the `BorrowCommand` constructor. Input for the `payback` command is tokenized and supplied to the `PaybackCommand` constructor in the same manner.

The `BorrowCommand` and `PaybackCommand` are executed in `LogicManager`.
`BorrowCommand` updates the `debt`, `totalDebt` and `dateRepaid` attributes in the target `Person` object through the `ModelManager#addDebtToPerson()` which calls `AddressBook#addDebtToPerson()`. A new `Person` object is then created with the updated `debt` and `totalDebt` amount. Also, the `dateRepaid` field is set to `NOT REPAID`.  The target `Person` object is then replaced with this new `Person` object.

`PaybackCommand` updates the target person's debt in the same manner as the `BorrowCommand`. However, only the `debt` attribute is updated. If the person has fully repaid his/her debts, the `PaybackCommand` will set the date repaid to the day the `PaybackCommand` was executed. The person will also be listed in the whitelist.

[NOTE]
For the `BorrowCommand`, the `DateBorrow` field in the new `Person` object needs to be updated to match the `DateBorrow` field in the target `Person` object. This is because the date of creation of the `Person` object is assigned to the `DateBorrow` field when a `Person` object is created.

The following sequence diagram, Figure 4.2.1, shows further details of the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component when the `borrow` command is executed:

image::BorrowCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Sequence diagram of how the `borrow` command works_

The `payback` command works in a similar way to the `borrow` command.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `BorrowCommandParser` and `PaybackCommandParser` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Tokenize arguments using `String#split()` +
**Pros:** Easier to parse arguments using `String#split` method since there are no prefixes in the command input. It is also easier to validate the number of arguments entered by the user. This can be done through checking the length of the `String` array returned by `String#split`. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize arguments +
**Pros:** Better modularity. +
**Cons:** Requires modifications to `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` since supplying whitespace as a prefix to the current `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` method incorrectly tokenizes arguments.

For example:

Entered command: `borrow 1 500` +
Prefix supplied to `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize` method: `" "` +
Outcome: prefix `" "` will be mapped to `1 500` in `argMultimap`. Index and amount borrowed are not separated. +

---

**Aspect:** Updating `Debt` field +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `Person` object, called `editedPerson`, by supplying the target `ReadOnlyPerson` object to constructor `Person::new` +
**Pros:** Straightforward and simple to implement. +
**Cons:** `Debt` class will need to have another constructor that takes in a `Double` parameter for simpler implementation of `AddressBook#addDebtToPerson()`. +
**Alternative 2:** Reusing the `AddressBook#updatePerson()` method +
**Pros:** Do not have to write the method from scratch. +
**Cons:** A new `Person` object still has to be created in order to edit the `Debt` field. Since `Addressbook#updatePerson()` only accepts `ReadOnlyPerson` objects as parameters, more code has to be written to convert the `Person` object to be a `ReadOnlyPerson` object. +
// end::borrowPaybackCommand[]

// tag::backup[]
=== Backup storage mechanism

The backup storage mechanism is facilitated by the `StorageManager`. It backs up the address book data automatically each time the application starts up, if there is existing data available. The sequence diagram for this is shown below in Figure 4.3.


image::BackupAddressBookSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1: Sequence diagram for backing up address book data_

The `backupAddressBook` method is called in `MainApp#init()` which is called each time the application starts. No backup is made if there is no existing data.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** When to create the backup +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create it on application start up +
**Pros:** Guarantees that a backup is made only of a working version of the address book that the user can easily revert to, should he/she mess up the main copy while using the application. +
**Cons:** Not suitable for users who tend to make many changes within one session, as too many changes will not be backed up. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement a command to create backup +
**Pros:** The backup is only created when the user desires to. +
**Cons:** This makes the implementation pointless altogether as it is meant as a safety net for clumsy users. This alternative would only benefit the careful users, who do not require it as much in the first place. +
**Alternative 3:** Create a backup after a fixed number of commands that change the address book +
**Pros:** This will create backups that are guaranteed to be recent. +
**Cons:** It is difficult to determine the ideal number of commands to ensure that the backup is both recent enough, yet outdated enough for the user to want to restore state to should he/she mess up a command at some point. +
// end::backup[]

// tag::datestoring[]
=== Date storing mechanism

The date storing mechanism only begins to work when an instance of the `Person` class is implemented. An instance of the `Date` class is created and used to store the current date that the `Person` instance was created.
An example of such an implementation of this is the `dateBorrow` field of `Person`.
[source,java]
----
public class Person implements ReadOnlyPerson {

    private ObjectProperty<Name> name;
    private ObjectProperty<Phone> phone;
    private ObjectProperty<Email> email;
    private ObjectProperty<Address> address;
    private ObjectProperty<PostalCode> postalCode;
    private ObjectProperty<Cluster> cluster;
    private ObjectProperty<Debt> debt;
    private ObjectProperty<Interest> interest;
    private ObjectProperty<DateBorrow> dateBorrow;
----
Such an implementation doesn't allow for errors when creating the field as there is no room for mistakes on the user's side. When the `Person` instance is created, the following line is called: +
[source,java]
----
    this.dateBorrow = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(new DateBorrow());
----
Suppose the above line is called, the `DateBorrow` class creates a new `Date` with the following line:
[source, java]
----
    public DateBorrow() {
        Date date = new Date();
        value = formatDate(date);
    }
----
This way of implementation is rather intuitive when adding a new `Person` as a new `Date` can simply be created. However, whenever a `Person` constructor is called, such as the following:
[source,java]
----
    public Person(ReadOnlyPerson source) {
        this(source.getName(), source.getPhone(), source.getEmail(), source.getAddress(), source.getPostalCode(),
                source.getDebt(), source.getInterest(), source.getDeadline(), source.getTags());
----
This would result in inconsistencies in the code. For example, an `Edit` command is implemented in such a way that it creates an `editedPerson`.
This is because the above mentioned constructor was meant to make a copy of the `Person` with a given source. Hence the following line was added to ensure consistency.
[source,java]
----
        this.dateBorrow = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(source.getDateBorrow());
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DateBorrow` +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Create a `DateBorrow` class as such but modify the constructor to maintain consistency +
**Pros:** Blends well with existing coding style and how the commands work. +
**Cons:** As of now there is no problems with the implementation. +
**Alternative 2:** Have the user manually key in the date +
**Pros:** Implementation is very simple as the developer could just follow current coding style to create a new field. +
**Cons:** Such an implementation would not be as user-friendly as the first alternative. Currently the amount of fields for the user to key in
is rather high. Implementing alternative 2 would be more tedious on the user's side.
// end::datestoring[]

// tag::list[]
=== List (Masterlist, Blacklist, etc.) mechanism

Having multiple lists is useful for debt collectors to view debtors of different categories. Currently, these different lists include masterlist and blacklist.

These lists could be viewed with the respective commands that will update the panel that is currently displayed. The commands to display these lists are named after the lists themselves. For example, to view the `blacklist`, the command typed is "blacklist" or "bl".

The following sequence diagram, Figure 4.5.1, shows further details of the interaction between the user and various application components as a whole, when the blacklist command is executed:

image::BlacklistCommandSequenceDiagram1.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1 : Sequence diagram of how the `blacklist` command works_

The following sequence diagram, Figure 4.5.2, shows further details of the interaction between `ModelManager` and `ReadOnlyAddressBook` to obtain the blacklist:

image::BlacklistCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.2 : Sequence diagram of how `ModelManager` interacts with `ReadOnlyAddressBook` To generate blacklist From all persons_

The List mechanism is facilitated by commands which use `Logic` interface to obtain the copy of the list that is required. As seen from Figure 4.5.1 and Figure 4.5.2 above, to obtain the current blacklist of the addressbook, "blacklist" `String` is first captured by the `CommandBox` class. The `CommandBox` class then passes this `String` to the `Logic` interface for execution.

`Logic` interface uses `LogicManager` class to validate the written command and package it as a `Command` object. The respective command is then executed in `LogicManager` class. These are the instructions that are executed for this command:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() {
    requireNonNull(model);
    model.deselectPerson();
    model.changeListTo(COMMAND_WORD);
    model.updateFilteredBlacklistedPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_BLACKLISTED_PERSONS);
    String currentList = ListObserver.getCurrentListName();
    return new CommandResult(currentList + MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

Specifically for `blacklist` command, it calls the `getFiltererdBlacklistedPersons()` method residing in the `Logic` interface. `LogicManager` subsequently calls `Model` interface. `Model` uses `ModelManager` class to handle the command and thereafter calls `ReadOnlyAddressBook` interface to handle the request. `ReadOnlyAddressBook` uses `AddressBook` class to handle this request.

In the `AddressBook` class, there is only one `persons` variable that stores all `ReadOnlyPerson` class objects. The blacklisted persons are obtained by running a check on all debtors residing in this variable. The check is executed using the `asObservableBlacklist()` method, as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> asObservableBlacklist() {
    return FXCollections.unmodifiableObservableList(mappedList.stream()
            .filter(person -> person.isBlacklisted()).collect(toCollection(FXCollections::observableArrayList)));
}
----

Although this way of implementation seems inefficient, it supports robust synchronisation among the various other lists. For example, if a person is deleted from the masterlist, he will also be deleted from the blacklist. Likewise for various other commands that changes the `ReadOnlyPerson` object. Thus, it is efficient in this aspect. Moreover, this implementation sets the groundwork for future implementations of various other lists.

One other important aspect to this implementation is that commands now have exclusive control over the list. This means that commands will only work on the persons in the current displayed list. For example, `find` command will only search and find persons in the current displayed list. It will not try to search in the masterlist, where all the contacts are stored. `sort` command will only sort the persons in the current displayed list. If the current displayed list is the blacklist, the output of the `sort` command will just be a list of sorted blacklisted persons.

However, if a `Person` is modified by a command, the modification will be reflected across all other lists. For example, if a person exists in both the blacklist and the overdue list, modifications done by an `edit` command in the blacklist will also update the overdue list. These changes can be observed when the user switches to the overdue list using the `overduelist` command.

==== Design Considerations:

**Aspect:** Syncing of lists +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use manual syncing methods to ensure lists are in sync +
**Pros:** Easy to extend for future implementations. +
**Cons:** Methods used for syncing are less intuitive and difficult to comprehend. +
**Alternative 2:** Create new `persons` variable for each list in `Addressbook` class +
**Pros:** Implementation is easier to comprehend. +
**Cons:** Waste of memory compared to current implementation which only has 1 `persons` variable in `Addressbook` class.
// end::list[]

// tag::cluster[]
=== Cluster mechanism

As a debt collector that operates in all parts of Singapore, it would boost efficiency in deciding debt collection trips
if the contacts can be effectively grouped by link:cluster[clusters]. It is determined based on the postal code provided
upon adding a `Person` into the address book. This can be seen in the constructors of the `Person` class and the
`Cluster` class.
[source, java]
----
public Person(Name name, Phone phone, Email email, Address address, PostalCode postalCode,
              Debt debt, Interest interest, Deadline deadline, Set<Tag> tags) {
    requireAllNonNull(name, phone, email, address, postalCode, debt, interest, deadline, tags);
    // assignment of other fields omitted for brevity
    this.cluster = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(new Cluster(postalCode));
}
----
[source, java]
----
public Cluster(PostalCode postalCode) {
    requireNonNull(postalCode);
    if (!isValidPostalCode(postalCode.toString())) {
        throw new AssertionError(MESSAGE_POSTAL_CODE_CONSTRAINTS);
    }
    String cluster = getCluster(postalCode.toString());
    clusterNumber = Integer.parseInt(cluster.substring(0, 2));
    this.value = cluster.substring(4);
}
----
The `getCluster` method resides in the `ClusterUtil` class, and returns the name of the postal district based on the
first two numbers of the postal code that is passed into the method. The postal districts are retrieved from [https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/resources/misc/list_of_postal_districts.htm[URA]].
The district number is stored as part of the `String` for ease of sorting by location.
Part of the code from `ClusterUtil` for retrieving the `cluster` from a postal code starting with `01` is shown below:
[source, java]
----
public class ClusterUtil {

    public static final String CLUSTER_POSTAL_DISTRICT_01 = "01. Raffles Place, Cecil, Marina, People's Park";
    // declaration of other postal districts omitted for brevity
    public static final String CLUSTER_POSTAL_DISTRICT_UNKNOWN = "99. Unknown";

    public static String getCluster(String postalCode) {
        requireNonNull(postalCode);
        int postalSector = Integer.parseInt(postalCode.substring(0, 2));
        switch (postalSector) {
        case 1:
        case 2:
        case 3:
        case 4:
        case 5:
        case 6:
            return CLUSTER_POSTAL_DISTRICT_01;
        // cases for all other valid postal districts omitted for brevity
        default:
            return CLUSTER_POSTAL_DISTRICT_UNKNOWN;
        }
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Grouping of contacts +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a field that contains the name and district number of the postal districts, based on postal code +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and extend, requires minimal user input. +
**Cons:** Requires developer to update `ClusterUtil` whenever a new postal district is drawn by the government, and
requires users to reset their contacts' `cluster` via deletion and addition or via editing their `postal codes`. +
**Alternative 2:** Import contacts' location and find their proximity from one another using Google Maps API +
**Pros:** Higher precision of geographical location and proximity. +
**Cons:** Tedious to implement proximity. Either takes up too much time in generating nearby contacts or too much space
 in storing them. +
**Alternative 3:** Assign general location to each contact upon addition into the address book or via editing +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Tedious for users. They also have to ensure that they do not make spelling mistakes.
// end::cluster[]

// tag::filterTags[]
=== Filter by tags mechanism

The `filter` command allows the user to filter contacts by tags. Multiple tags can be entered. The command returns a list of contacts that match *at least one* of the tags that is specified by the user.

Since the filtered person list stored in the `ModelManager` class is of the type FilteredList<>, filtering of the list can be done easily using Java’s `FilteredList#setPredicate()` method.
Hence, a `PersonContainsTagPredicate` is created to check if a `Person` object contains the tags of interest. The code snippet below shows how the `PersonContainsTagPredicate` is implemented to sieve out the relevant contacts. The `Stream#anyMatch()` method ensures that the filtered list contains persons who have at least one tag specified by the user.
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Evaluates this predicate on the given {@code person}. This predicate tests if a person contains at least one tag
 * from {@code tagKeywords}.
 * @return {@code true} if the person matches the predicate,
 * otherwise {@code false}
 */
@Override
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    Set<Tag> tagList = person.getTags();
    for (Tag tag : tagList) {
        if (tagKeywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(tag.tagName, keyword))) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
----

The list is filtered and updated through `ListObserver#updateCurrentFilteredList()` in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package, instead of `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()`, so that it works across all lists (masterlist, blacklist, whitelist and overdue list).

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `PersonContainsTagPredicate` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Predicate returns true if at least one tag matches the list of tags specified by the user +
**Pros:** More contacts will be shown to the user. The additional information may be useful to the user. +
**Cons:** The user may find some of the filtered contacts irrelevant. +
**Alternative 2:** Predicate returns true only if the person contains the exact tags that are specified by the user +
**Pros:** Shows the most relevant results if the user wants to search for an exact match. +
**Cons:** If the contacts have multiple tags and the user remembers just one of the tags wrongly, the `filter` command will return zero results.
// end::filterTags[]

// tag::loginLogout[]
=== Login/logout mechanism

Although there are two versions for login, the Graphic User Interface(GUI) version and the Command Line Interface(CLI) version, they both use the same login mechanism (see Figure 4.8.1 below). The GUI login is recommended over the CLI login because it has better password masking capabilities.
This is because the password field in the GUI login is implemented using JavaFX 8's `PasswordField`. The CLI login exists, despite the inconsistent password masking, to allow the user to log into the app faster since using a one-shot command is faster than a multi-step command.
The bugs in the CLI login could be resolved by removing password masking. However, this would have security implications because the password is not concealed.

After a user logs in using either the CLI or GUI login, verification of the login information will take place in the `Model` component. The username and password are verified against the information stored in `preferences.json`.

The password is stored as a SHA-512 hash to conceal the actual password. The salt that is used to generate the hashed password is also stored. Since the stored hash cannot be converted back to the original password, the password that is entered by the user needs to be hashed and verified against the stored hash. Thus, the same salt needs to be used to generate a hash to match with the stored hash. If a different salt is used, then the generated hash will be different from the stored hash even if the password provided is correct.

After verifying that the username and password matches the information stored in `preferences.json`, an event is raised to notify the `UI` component of the user authentication result. If the user has successfully logged in, the `UI` component will display the person list, info panel and allow other commands (such as `list`, `edit, `add`, etc.) to be executed from the command box.

The activity diagram below, Figure 4.8.1, shows the overall flow of the command execution for both GUI and CLI login:
image::LoginActivityDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.8.1 : Activity diagram of how the `login` command works for both CLI and GUI version_

When a user enters the `logout` command, the `LogoutCommand` class in the `Logic` component will call the `ModelManager#logout()` method. Two events will be raised: `LoginAppRequestEvent` and `LogoutAppRequestEvent`. `LoginAppRequestEvent` is to set the `isLoggedIn` variable in `LoginCommand` to `false` and `LogoutAppRequestEvent` is to set the `isLoggedOut` variable in `LogoutCommand` to `true`. Both events need to be raised to notify the `UI` component to go back to the welcome page and restrict the commands that are allowed to be executed.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of password masking +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Use the unicode character 'BLACK CIRCLE' (●) for password masking +
**Pros:** Other characters can be detected as password input, such as the asterisk character '\*' which is commonly used for password masking. +
**Alternative 2:** Use the asterisk character (*) for password masking +
**Pros:** User may use the asterisk character when entering the password. The asterisk character will be ignored and will not show in the text field when it is entered. This is because the method that handles password masking ignores the character used to mask the password. Refer to the code snippet below for the implementation: +
[source,java]
----
/*
 * mask password after the second whitespace and prevent the reading of the BLACK_CIRCLE after replacing
 * a character in the command box text field with a BLACK_CIRCLE
 */
if (numOfSpaces >= 2 && currentInput.charAt(currentInput.length() - 1) != ' '
        && currentInput.charAt(currentInput.length() - 1) != BLACK_CIRCLE) {
    maskPasswordInput(currentInput);
}
----
**Cons:** Although '\*' is an invalid password character, the user may still use it while entering the password. Hence, if the user types '*', the cursor will remain at its original position. The user will be under the impression that the command box is not registering what was typed.
// end::loginLogout[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting mechanism

Sorting is done within the `UniquePersonList` class.
[source, java]
----
public void sortBy(String order) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    switch (order) {
    case "name":
        internalList.sort((Person p1, Person p2) -> p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName()));
        break;
    case "debt":
        internalList.sort((Person p1, Person p2) -> p2.getDebt().compareTo(p1.getDebt()));
        break;
    case "cluster":
        internalList.sort((Person p1, Person p2) -> p1.getCluster().compareTo(p2.getCluster()));
        break;
    case "deadline":
        internalList.sort((Person p1, Person p2) -> p1.getDeadline().compareTo(p2.getDeadline()));
        internalList.sort((Person p1, Person p2) -> Boolean.compare(p1.isWhitelisted(), p2.isWhitelisted()));
        break;
    default:
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid sort ordering");
    }
}
----
The `sort` command can take in a `String` that determines how the contacts should be sorted. If no ordering is
specified, the contacts will be sorted by ascending lexicographical order by default. +
[source, java]
----
public class SortCommandParser implements Parser<SortCommand> {
    public SortCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        requireNonNull(args);
        String trimmedArgs = args.trim().toLowerCase();
        switch (trimmedArgs) {
        case "":
        case "name":
        case "debt":
        case "cluster":
        case "deadline":
            return new SortCommand(trimmedArgs);
        default:
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, SortCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
}
----
[source, java]
----
public static final String DEFAULT_ORDERING = "name";

public SortCommand(String order) {
    //validity of order to sort is checked in {@code SortCommandParser}
    if (order.equals("")) {
        order = DEFAULT_ORDERING;
    }
    this.order = order;
}

public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    try {
        model.sortBy(order);
    } // irrelevant parts of the method omitted for brevity
}
----

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Default `sort` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Sort` by `name` by default +
**Pros:** Relatively easy to implement, extremely intuitive. +
**Alternative 2:** `Sort` by `debt` by default +
**Pros:** Equally easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Slightly less intuitive as sorting by `name` is the most prevalent way of sorting contacts. +
**Alternative 3:** No default `sort` +
**Pros:** Extremely easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Not user-friendly.
// end::sort[]

// tag::optionalIndex[]
=== Optional command indexes

It is intuitive to allow commands such as `edit`, `delete`, `borrow` and others to be called on the currently selected
person instead of always having to supply the `INDEX`. +
Parsers of commands call a constructor of the commands without an index. Take the `RepaidCommandParser` and `RepaidCommand` for example.
[source, java]
----
public RepaidCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    try {
        if (args.trim().equals("")) {
            return new RepaidCommand();
        } else {
            Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
            return new RepaidCommand(index);
        }
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(
            String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, RepaidCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
}
----
[source, java]
----
public RepaidCommand() throws CommandException {
    personToWhitelist = selectPersonForCommand();
}

public RepaidCommand(Index targetIndex) throws CommandException {
    personToWhitelist = selectPersonForCommand(targetIndex);
}
----
The `selectPersonForCommand()` and `selectPersonForCommand(Index)` methods are placed in the `Command` class, and is used by such index-based commands to select
the currently selected person to apply the command on if no index is provided.
[source, java]
----
public ReadOnlyPerson selectPersonForCommand() throws CommandException {
    if (ListObserver.getSelectedPerson() == null) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_NO_PERSON_SELECTED);
    }
    return ListObserver.getSelectedPerson();
}

public ReadOnlyPerson selectPersonForCommand(Index index) throws CommandException {
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = ListObserver.getCurrentFilteredList();
    if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
    }
    return lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Executing index-based commands without index +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The person to apply the commands on are determined in the constructors +
**Pros:** Allows for proper `redo`. +
**Cons:** Hard to test as Command Exceptions are being thrown from the constructors. +
**Alternative 2:** Calling a constructor of the `command` without an `Index` initialises its `targetIndex`
to null, and the null index is handled as a special value during execution +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, easy to extend. +
**Cons:** Although highly unlikely, it may be possible for a `command` to have an unintended null `targetIndex`, which
will then cause it to behave as an indexless command instead of an error. May also cause problems with `redo`.
// end::optionalIndex[]

// tag::interest[]
=== Interest Calculator Mechanism

As a debt collector, it can be troublesome to manage so many debts. The task is made more tedious when the debt collector has to
consider all the debtor's loan's interest rates as well. Codii is able to automatically calculate a `Person` 's new debt based on his / her's
interest rate. Whenever the user logs into Codii, the `Model` component, which handles the event `LoginAppRequestEvent` and checks every
`Person` in the `AddressBook`.

[source, java]
----
@Subscribe
    public void handleLoginUpdateDebt(LoginAppRequestEvent event) {
        // login is successful
        if (event.getLoginStatus() == true) {
            for (ReadOnlyPerson person : allPersons) {
                if (!person.getInterest().value.equals("No interest set.")
                        && (person.checkLastAccruedDate(new Date()) != 0)) {
                    updateDebtFromInterest(person, person.checkLastAccruedDate(new Date()));
                }
            }
        }
    }
----

As seen from the above if a `Person` has his / her interest field defined,the event handler checks a `Person` 's debts last accrued date via the method:

[source, java]
----
    /**
     * Compares date of last accrued against current date.
     * @return number of months the current date is ahead of last accrued date. Returns 0 if
     * there is no need to increment debt.
     */
    @Override
    public int checkLastAccruedDate(Date currentDate) {
        if (lastAccruedDate.before(currentDate)) {
            return DateUtil.getNumberOfMonthBetweenDates(currentDate, lastAccruedDate);
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
----

The above method returns the difference in the number of months between the last accrued date and the current date to the event handler. The event
handler than calls another method to update the `Person` 's debt by passing in the number of months as a parameter:

[source, java]
----
    @Override
    public void updateDebtFromInterest(ReadOnlyPerson person, int differenceInMonths) {
        String accruedAmount = person.calcAccruedAmount(differenceInMonths);
        try {
            Debt amount = new Debt(accruedAmount);
            addDebtToPerson(person, amount);
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            assert false : "Should not occur as person obtained from allPersons";
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            assert false : Debt.MESSAGE_DEBT_CONSTRAINTS;
        }
    }
----

From the above code, the `Person` 's debts accrued amount would be calculated by the line:

[source, java]
----
String accruedAmount = person.calcAccruedAmount(differenceInMonths);
----

Their respective debts would then be updated accordingly with the following line:

[source, java]
----
addDebtToPerson(person, amount);
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** When to update / check a Person's debt +
**Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Check through the `AddressBook` in the `Model` component every time the user logs in +
**Pros:** Convenient and intuitive to implement for developer. +
**Cons:** If user never logs out, the debt would not be accrued. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a `Refresh` command that does the checking instead of relying on the `LoginAppRequestEvent` +
**Pros:** User can have the most up-to-date debt as long as he / she remembers to always enter the `Refresh` command. +
**Cons:** Not convenient for user at all. It is also unlikely that the user would remain logged in for such a long duration. +
// end::interest[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Theme Changing Mechanism

The changing of themes is done in the `MainWindow` class, which is the class that holds all the `UI` parts.

[source, java]
----
private void changeTheme() {
    for (String stylesheet : getRoot().getStylesheets()) {
        if (stylesheet.endsWith("DarkTheme.css")) {
            getRoot().getStylesheets().remove(stylesheet);
            getRoot().getStylesheets().add("/view/BrightTheme.css");
            break;
        } else if (stylesheet.endsWith("BrightTheme.css")) {
            getRoot().getStylesheets().remove(stylesheet);
            getRoot().getStylesheets().add("/view/DarkTheme.css");
            break;
        }
    }
}
----

The `changeTheme` method is called when a `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` is raised from `ThemeCommand`.

In `MainWindow`:
[source, java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleChangeThemeRequestEvent(ChangeThemeRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    changeTheme();
}
----
In `ThemeCommand`:
[source, java]
----
public CommandResult execute() {
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent());
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Condition for changing themes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `String#endsWith()` +
**Pros:** Foolproof, guaranteed to work if the theme exists. +
**Alternative 2:** Use file paths +
**Pros:** Likely to work most of the time if handled well. +
**Cons:** When debugging, it was found that the path started in the `build` folder instead of the `src` folder. Using
this method seemed to cause inconsistencies between running the app from an IDE and from the `.jar` file.

---

**Aspect:** Switching of themes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Simple toggle between two themes +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Troublesome to extend. +
** Alternative 2:** Use an `int` to keep track of the current theme, assign each theme to a number, and use `+` and `%`
to cycle through the themes +
**Pros:** Easy to extend. +
**Cons:** Troublesome to implement considering that we intend to use only two themes.
// end::theme[]

// tag::repaid[]
=== Repaid command mechanism

The `repaid` command allow users to indicate that the specified debtor has completely repaid all of his/her debt. The `RepaidCommand` extends `UndoableCommand` so that it can be undone and redone if necessary.

The command executes using the index of the person the user wishes to update. However, indicating the index is optional if the person is the current selected person in the person list panel, as the index is internally provided by the selected person card.

The `RepaidCommand` is executed in `LogicManager`. It checks if the person selected has already repaid all his/her debt. If the person has done so, the command will then throw an `Exception` indicating that he/she has already repaid his/her debt.

If the person has not completely repaid his/her debt, `LogicManager` will then call the `Model` interface to execute a three-step process on that person, using a single method. `ModelManager` will firstly reset the person's debt to zero.

[source, java]
----
public ReadOnlyPerson resetPersonDebt(ReadOnlyPerson p) throws PersonNotFoundException {
    int index;
    index = persons.getIndexOf(p);

    Person existingPerson = new Person(p);
    try {
        existingPerson.setDebt(new Debt(Debt.DEBT_ZER0_VALUE));
    } catch (IllegalValueException e) {
        assert false : "The target value cannot be of illegal value";
    }

    persons.remove(p);

    try {
        persons.add(index, existingPerson);
    } catch (DuplicatePersonException dpe) {
        assert false : "There should be no duplicate when resetting the debt of a person";
    }

    return persons.getReadOnlyPerson(index);
}
----

Secondly, it will set the `dateRepaid` field of the person to the date the command was called.

[source, java]
----
public ReadOnlyPerson setDateRepaid(ReadOnlyPerson p) throws PersonNotFoundException {
    int index;
    index = persons.getIndexOf(p);

    Person existingPerson = new Person(p);
    existingPerson.setDateRepaid(new DateRepaid(formatDate(new Date())));

    persons.remove(p);

    try {
        persons.add(index, existingPerson);
    } catch (DuplicatePersonException dpe) {
        assert false : "There should be no duplicate when resetting the date repaid field of a person";
    }

    return persons.getReadOnlyPerson(index);
}
----

Finally, the person will be added into a list called `Whitelist`, given that he was not initially blacklisted.

[source, java]
----
public ReadOnlyPerson addWhitelistedPerson(ReadOnlyPerson p) {
    int index;
    index = persons.getIndexOf(p);

    Person newWhitelistedPerson = new Person(p);
    newWhitelistedPerson.setIsWhitelisted(true);
    try {
        updatePerson(p, newWhitelistedPerson);
    } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
        throw new AssertionError("The target person cannot be a duplicate");
    } catch (PersonNotFoundException e) {
        throw new AssertionError("This is not possible as prior checks have been done");
    }
    return persons.getReadOnlyPerson(index);
}
----

`ModelManager` will then return the updated `ReadOnlyPerson` `Object` back to `LogicManager`.

**Aspect:** Three-step process in one `Command` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The three-step process happens in a single method +
**Pros:** Faster and simpler to implement the method. +
**Cons:** Some methods will fail to update the person as intended. If the person is blacklisted, he/she will not be added into the whitelist. +
**Alternative 2:** Include three separate methods in `Model` interface to execute the three-step process +
**Pros:** Easy to observe the methods that will fail. +
**Cons:** Methods in `Model` interface will seem to have less abstraction than intended. +
// end::repaid[]

// tag::setpath/addpic/delpic[]
=== Setpath/Addpic/Delpic command mechanism

`Setpath`, `Addpic` and `Delpic` commands facilitate updating a debtor's display picture. `Setpath` command sets the `path` to a folder that contains `JPG` format images of the debtors. This folder resides in the user's workspace.

The images in the folder must initially be named after the debtors themselves. For example, a debtor named Alex Yeoh should have an image titled `AlexYeoh.jpg` in this folder.

`Setpath` command modifies the destined `path` in the `ProfilePicturesFolder` `class`:

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    ProfilePicturesFolder.setPath(reformatPath(path));
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

`Addpic` command takes in an index as the input and uses `Logic` interface to execute a two-step process to update the person's display picture status. `LogicManager` calls `Model` interface to first search for the image in the path directory set by the `SetPath` command. This is done by first establishing the name of the image, and then searching for it in the required folder.

[source, java]
----
@Override
    public boolean addProfilePicture(ReadOnlyPerson person) throws ProfilePictureNotFoundException {
        String imageName = person.getName().toString().replaceAll("\\s+", "");
        File imageFile = new File(ProfilePicturesFolder.getPath() + imageName + JPG_EXTENSION);

        if (imageFile.exists()) {
            addressBook.addProfilePic(person);
            indicateAddressBookChanged();
            return true;
        } else {
            throw new ProfilePictureNotFoundException();
        }
    }
----

`ModelManager` checks if the image exists in the path directory. If it does, it will then set the boolean value of the person's `hasDisplayPicture` variable to true.

[source, java]
----
public ReadOnlyPerson addProfilePic(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        int index;
        index = persons.getIndexOf(person);

        Person newUpdatedPerson = new Person(person);
        newUpdatedPerson.setHasDisplayPicture(true);
        try {
            updatePerson(person, newUpdatedPerson);
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target person cannot be a duplicate");
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("This is not possible as prior checks have been done");
        }

        return persons.getReadOnlyPerson(index);
    }
----

When the `PersonCard` corresponding to the person is selected, `hasDisplayPicture` boolean value is obtained. If the value is `true`, the image will be retrieved from the previously set `path`. If it does not exist, a default image will be displayed.

[source, java]
----
public DebtorProfilePicture(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        super(FXML);
        String imageName = person.getName().toString().replaceAll("\\s+", "");
        String imagePath = DEFAULT_PROFILEPIC_PATH;
        Image image = new Image(getClass().getResource(imagePath).toExternalForm());

        if (person.hasDisplayPicture()) {

            imagePath = ProfilePicturesFolder.getPath() + imageName + JPG_EXTENSION;
            File imageFile = new File(imagePath);

            if (!imageFile.exists()) {
                person.setHasDisplayPicture(false);
                raise(new MissingDisplayPictureEvent(person));
            } else {
                try {
                    image = new Image(imageFile.toURI().toURL().toExternalForm());
                } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }

        profilePic.setImage(image);
        profilePic.setFitWidth(450);
        profilePic.setFitHeight(450);
        profilePicPlaceHolder.setTopAnchor(this.getImageView(), 20.0);
        profilePicPlaceHolder.setRightAnchor(this.getImageView(), 50.0);
        registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
    }
----

`Delpic` command, similarly, resets the person's `hasDisplayPicture` boolean value to false.

[source, java]
----

public ReadOnlyPerson removeProfilePic(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        int index;
        index = persons.getIndexOf(person);

        Person newUpdatedPerson = new Person(person);
        newUpdatedPerson.setHasDisplayPicture(false);
        try {
            updatePerson(person, newUpdatedPerson);
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target person cannot be a duplicate");
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("This is not possible as prior checks have been done");
        }

        return persons.getReadOnlyPerson(index);
    }
----

**Aspect:** Storage of profile pictures in Codii +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Images are not stored in Codii as they are read from the path directory provided by the user +
**Pros:** Straightforward and simpler to implement. +
**Cons:** Application cannot be easily transferred from one workstation to another. +
**Alternative 2:** Store images in Codii similar to how XML files are stored +
**Pros:** Far less hassle in transferring application content to another workstation. +
**Cons:** The result of both implementations are very similar. However, this implementation is harder to execute. +

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels:*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in Figure 5.3.1 below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.3.1: Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

Note that due to the nature of the Date Borrow field in Person Class, +
it is advisable that developers do not test at midnight where the date might change.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner:*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle:*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless):*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`:**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives: +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the address book.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
