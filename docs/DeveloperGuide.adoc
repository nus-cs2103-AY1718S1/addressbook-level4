== Introduction

=== Software Overview

Welcome to cherBook, the Command Line application designed to help teachers monitor students' academic performance easily.
With our tagging system and data analysis tools, teachers can view statistics of any specific groups of students.
This helps teachers by breaking down students' grades and identifying students who need extra attention.
Finally, if ever the need arises, student's parent contact details can be found in just one command, making cherBook the fastest way to contact students' parents.

=== About this guide

This developer guide  provides future contributors and maintainers of cherBook with the necessary information to understand
the cherBook source code and guidelines for contributing to the repository.
Such information include cherBook's software architecture, major components, APIs, Documentation and contributing guidelines.

== Setting up

Follow the instructions below to set up and configure cherBook project files on your computer.

=== Prerequisites

Before you can start configuring, you need to have the following software installed:

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has link:#Gradle[Gradle] and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://oss-generic.github.io/process/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Java.html[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103AUG2017-T16-B2/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103AUG2017-T16-B2/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up link:#Travis_CI[Travis] to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

This section explains to you the design of the app, its architecture and components.
It also contains the details, reasons and mechanisms behind major system components and the interactions between these components.

=== Architecture [[architecture]]

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its link:#API[_API_] in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ExtendedPersonCard`, `StatisticsPanel`, `GraphPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section explains to you in detail how certain features of the cherBook are implemented.
The relevant diagrams and code examples will be used to aid the understanding of the features' implementation.

// tag::commandshortcuts[]
=== Command Alias mechanism

The Command Alias mechanism is facilitated by the `COMMAND_ALIAS` in each `Command` class and the `parseCommand()` method in `AddressBookParser`.
The `AddressBookParser` is responsible for analyzing command words while each command's `COMMAND_ALIAS` stores the command alias to be accepted by the parser.

The aliased added to each command class is implemented like this e.g. `FindCommand` :

```
public class FindCommand extends Command {
    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "find";
    public static final String COMMAND_ALIAS = "f";
    //...... other logic ......
}
```
Just like how we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside each `Command` class e.g. `FindCommand.COMMAND_WORD`, `DeleteCommand.COMMAND_WORD` , a new constant was added for each command alias e.g. `FindCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS`.

The `parseCommand()` in `AddressBookParser` is implemented like this:

```
 public Command parseCommand(String userInput) throws ParseException {
        final Matcher matcher = BASIC_COMMAND_FORMAT.matcher(userInput.trim());
        if (!matcher.matches()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, HelpCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        final String commandWord = matcher.group("commandWord");
        final String arguments = matcher.group("arguments");
        switch (commandWord) {

        case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD://Fallthrough
        case AddCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments);
        // ...... more conditions ......
        default:
            throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_UNKNOWN_COMMAND);
        }
    }
```

When a command alias is detected in the switch statement, it will result in the return statement below it, causing it to behave similarly to its corresponding command word.
When a command word is detected, it will fall through and executes the command as per normal.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Where to add the command Aliases +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add the aliases in each `Command` Class +
**Pros:** More cohesive command classes. +
**Cons:** None. +
**Alternative 2:** Add the aliases in the AddressBookParser.parseCommand(String) method. +
**Pros:** Easier to read code in the AddressBookParser . +
**Cons:** Use of magic numbers/strings means that the code is harder to trace and debug. +
// end::commandshortcuts[]

// tag::optionalInput[]
=== Optional Inputs/Fields mechanism

The `optional inputs/fields` mechanism is facilitated by making changes to `AddCommandParser` class in the `Logic` component.
This feature enables several input/fields of the student to be optional.

[NOTE]
Student's phone number, email, address and postal code are optional inputs/fields.

The following sequence diagram shows you how the `optional inputs/fields` operation works:

image::OptionalInputsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Sequence Diagram of Optional Inputs/Fields Operation_

The optionalInput method will append messages indicating that those optional fields are not recorded if the user chooses not to include those fields.
The method can be seen in the code section below.

----
    public static String optionalInput(String input) {
        if (!input.contains("a/")) {
            input = input + " a/ (Address not recorded)";
        }
        if (!input.contains("e/")) {
            input = input + " e/ (Email not recorded)";
        }
        if (!input.contains("c/")) {
            input = input + " c/ (Postal code not recorded)";
        }
        if (!input.contains(" p/")) {
            input = input + " p/ (Student phone not recorded)";
        }
        return input;
    }
----

The output of the method is illustrated in the following picture.

image::OptionalInputMessage.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.2.2 : Messages shown when the user does not enter the optional fields_

Prefixes of the optional fields - `PREFIX_PHONE`, `PREFIX_EMAIL`, `PREFIX_ADDRESS` and `PREFIX_POSTALCODE` are removed from
the code segment below. The ensures that the `ParseException` will not be thrown if the user chooses not to include the
optional fields.

----
if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_PARENTPHONE, PREFIX_FORMCLASS,
                PREFIX_GRADES)) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
----

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Implementation of optional fields/inputs. +
Alternative 1 (current choice): This feature manipulates the input to include the missing optional input prefix, along with a message
stating that the field is not recorded. +
Pros: Simpler to understand and tweak this feature as it only manipulates the parsed input of the user. +
Cons: Unable to implement UI features that requires the attribute to have a optional property. +
Alternative 2: This feature implements a optional characteristic in optional attributes. +
Pros: Optionality aspect of the attributes can be used by other features of cherBook. +
Cons: Harder to understand the mechanism and more work is required implement changes to this feature. +
// end::optionalInput[]

// tag::remark[]
===  Remark mechanism
The `remark` mechanism is facilitated by making changes to the `Remark` class in the `Model` component. It enables the user to overwrite a single `remark` of the student.

To avoid confusion and an overly complicated `UI`, only one `remark` per person is stored.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `remark` operation works:

image::RemarkSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Sequence Diagram of `Remark` Operation_

`Remark` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.2 : Inheritance Diagram for Commands_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class RemarkCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... remark logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...
      executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}
public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----
When the user adds a new `person` to the address book, that person's `remark` field will be denoted by `(add a remark)`. Users are then able to add a single `remark`.

[NOTE]
If the user tries to add `remark` together with adding a new `Person`, it will display as invalid as the `addCommand` does not allow the addition of remarks other then through the use of using the `Remark` command.

[NOTE]
When the user attempts to `add`/`edit` a remark via the `add`/`edit` command, he will be prompted by a message stating
that adding of remarks in `add`/`edit` command is not allowed.

[NOTE]
Only one `remark` is saved at any one time, if the user does `Remark` on the same person, it will be overwritten.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`. +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`. +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect** Implementation of `Remark` field. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a field in person as well as making it a command. +
**Pros:** Able to easily change context of the field without much hassle. +
**Cons:** Harder to debug as it is both a field and a command. +
**Alternative 2:** Making it a field only. +
**Pros:** Easier to keep track and debug. +
**Cons:** Much harder and longer to implement a feature to solely change the remarks.

---
// end::remark[]

// tag::findtags[]
=== FindTags mechanism

The `FindTagsCommand` class inheriteds from the `Command` class.
It allows users to search students by their tags.

The `FindTags` mechanism is facilitated by the `TagsContainKeywordsPredicate`, which resides within `FindTagsCommand`.
The `TagsContainKeywordsPredicate` tests whether each person's tags contain all keywords input by the user
and thus supports AND search.

The following sequence diagram shows how the FindTags operation works:

image::FindTagsSequenceDiagramForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : Sequence Diagram of `FindTags` Operation_

As can seen from above, when a `FindTags` command is called, E.g. `findtags NUS friends`.
An instance of `TagsContainKeywordsPredicate` is created.

The newly created `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` used to implement `FindTagsCommand` is shown below:

----
public class TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {
    private final List<String> keywords;

    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        return keywords.stream()
                .allMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getTagsAsString(), keyword));
    }
    // ... other logic ...
}
----

[NOTE]
The test is case insensitive as `StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase()` ignores case.
[NOTE]
This search operation is an `AND search`
So only persons with at least both `friends` and `NUS` will be displayed. Persons with only `friends` or only `NUS` will not be displayed. +

Inside the `TagsContainKeywordsPredicate`, the search terms `NUS` and `friends` are stored inside the `keywords` list.
The overidding `test()` method evluates whether the person's tags matches all the search terms in `keywords`.
This `TagsContainKeywordsPredicate` is then used to test every person in the AddressBook and filter them.

The newly created `FindTagsCommand` class is shown below:

----
public class FindTagsCommand extends Command {
    private final TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate;

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate);
        return new CommandResult(
            getMessageForPersonListShownSummary(model.getFilteredPersonList().size()));
    }
    // ... other logic ...
}
----

The `predicate` is passed through `model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` to update the `filteredPersonList`.
This causes the `filteredPersonList` to only contain students whose tags match all keywords `NUS` and `friends`
and also display them in the `PersonListPanel` UI element.

However if there are no persons with all keywords in the tags, the `PersonListPanel` will just be blank.

Meanwhile, the `ModelManager` posts a `AddressBookChanged event` and a `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` to the `EventsCenter`.
The `AddressBookChangedEvent` indicates that the `model` has changed and the causing the `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` updates the `StatisticsPanel` of the UI to reflect the new Statistics for the new list of students.

This search feature is implemented using `Predicate` because `Predicate` help move the business logic to a more central place, helping in unit-testing them separately.
Also, the `Predicate` can can be reused, improving code manageability and readability.

---

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Have a separate predicate class to support `findtags` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have a `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` to facilitate search. +
**Pros:** Easy for new Computer Science undergraduates to understand. They are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Makes the application more complex to understand according to the More Is More Complex (MIMC) principle. For example, a separate `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` class is needed when the same can be done by inserting it as an inner class in the `FindTagsCommand` class. +
**Alternative 2:** Create `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` as an inner class in `FindTagsCommand` class. +
**Pros:** It makes the codebase less complex as there are less classes. +
**Cons:** It adds complexity to the `FindTagsCommand` source file and reduces re-usability of the `Predicate` outside of the `FindTagsCommand` +

---

**Aspect:** Whether to use AND or OR search +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** AND search +
**Pros:** Allows users to find students with a specific combination of tags much more efficiently. +
E.g. `findtags band dance` only returns the list of students who have both the `band` and `dance` tag rather all students with either the `band` or `dance` tag. +
**Cons:** Does not allow users to calculate statistics for more than one group of students at a time.  +
E.g. `findtags band dance` cannot calculate  statistics for the `track` and `dance` groups combined. +
**Alternative 2:** OR search +
**Pros:** Allows users to calculate statistics for more than one group of students at a time. +
E.g. `findtags track dance` calculates statistics for the `track` and `dance` groups combined. +
**Cons:** Or search does not help teachers find students with a specific combination of tags efficiently. +
E.g. `findtags track dance` does not narrow down the list of students returned to students who have both the `track` and `dance` tag. +

---
// end::findtags[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1 : Stack Diagram of Initial Stack_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.2 : Stack Diagram of Commands Added_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.3 : Stack Diagram of Undo Execution_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.4 : Sequence Diagram of UndoRedo Feature_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.5 : Stack Diagram when a new Command, Clear is Executed_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.6 : Stack Diagram when Undoable Command is Executed_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

_Figure 4.5.7 : Activity Diagram of UndoRedoStack_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`. +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`. +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo. +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo. +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]


=== Sort mechanism
// tag::sortreason[]
The reason for the implementation of sort allows the user to organise their list of contacts in cherBook more easily.
This provides an alternative for them to view their contacts instead of the usual way - most recent added contact being added to the last index of the list.
Users will find it easier to browse through their list of contacts in situations where the `find` command cannot be used.
The `sort` mechanism is implemented using `SortCommand`. It supports the sorting of contact names in cherBook according to alphabetical order from A to Z.

// end::sortreason[]

// tag::sortimplementation[]
When the user calls for sorting to be implemented, an empty `ArrayList` would be created. Under the `Model` component, `UniquePersonList` would compare the names of all persons in lower case using a comparator and return an `Observable List` containing of ``ReadOnlyPerson``s.

`SortCommand` inherits from `Command`.

`SortCommand` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class SortCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... sort logic ...
    }
}
----
[NOTE]
The `sort` is case insensitive.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort` operation works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.1 : Sequence Diagram of Sort Operation_

When the user calls ‘sort’ or ‘st’ to `sort` the contacts, the `Model` will take in an `ArrayList` named contactList from the `Parser`.

Upon a successful `sort`, all contacts in cherBook are displayed in alphabetical order.
If an empty list is given, the address book will return with the message: “No contacts to be sorted”.
If the list is already in the correct alphabetical order, the address book will return with the following message: “All contacts are sorted alphabetically by name”.

The following code will show how the list is being returned to the user:
[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Returns an observable list as as an unmodifiable {@code ObservableList}
     */
    public ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> asObservableListSortedByName() {
        internalList.sort((o1, o2) ->((o1.getName().toString().toLowerCase())
                .compareTo(o2.getName().toString().toLowerCase())));
        return FXCollections.unmodifiableObservableList(mappedList);
    }
----
The sort mechanism is implemented this way to ensure that all person names in the `UniquePersonList` is compared to at the lowest level of abstraction.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `SortCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `SortCommand` inherits from Command. +
**Pros:** After sorting his/her contacts, it remains sorted and the original list of unsorted contacts is replaced by this list. +
**Cons:** The user is unable to save the list of contacts in the original order(unsorted format). +
**Alternative 2:** Implement undo/redo function for SortCommand. +
**Pros:** When undo is called, the list will return back to the most recent unsorted list. When redo is called, the list will return back to the sorted list of contacts. +
**Cons:** The user is able to alter the list easily and may get confused whether is the current list the most recent sorted list.

---

**Aspect:** How sort executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses the `comparator` in `Java Collections` to sort the arrays in alphabetical order. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Since method is inherited, it is difficult to debug and the only way is via the usage of vigorous user testing and logging. +
**Alternative 2:** Write a `sort` algorithm. +
**Pros:** Case sensitivity can be accounted for and debugging is made simpler. +
**Cons:** More error-proned as algorithm's logic must be checked constantly to ensure that it accounts for all cases.

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the `sort` command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates an empty `ArrayList` to obtain the names from the `UniquePersonList` before sorting occurs. The `sort` overwrites the existing list of unsorted contacts.  +
**Pros:** The original list of unsorted contacts is not altered. +
**Cons:** Additional space usage and longer time needed to overwrite the original contact list, inefficiency and memory wastage may arise. +
**Alternative 2:** Creates a new list of persons to sort each time a command that filters the person list is entered. +
**Pros:** User can sort accordingly to the filtered person list that he/she has implemented. Able to revert any changes if user does not want their contact list to be sorted. +
**Cons:** User have to continously use the sort command for every filtered person list change. Inefficient if the user wants their contact list to be sorted at all times. +
// end::sortimplementation[]


=== Add Schedule mechanism
// tag::schedulereason[]
The `schedule` mechanism is implemented using `ScheduleCommand`. It supports the scheduling of contacts in cherBook for better management of time.
The reason for the implementation of scheduling is to allow cherBook users (teacher/educator) to add schedules they have like consultations or meetings with their students or fellow colleagues.
With this scheduling command, users are able add their schedules with any person from their list of contacts just by typing the index of the person, the date and time of the schedule.
The date and time can be entered in natural language, helping users save their time to manually pen down their scheduled dates and timings.
// end::schedulereason[]

// tag::scheduleimplementation[]
When the user calls for scheduling to be implemented, two arguments would have to be passed into the constructor.
The two arguments are Name of the person being scheduled and the Calendar date with time.
Under the `Model` component, the created `schedule` is directly added into the address book.

`ScheduleCommand` inherits from `Command`.

ScheduleCommand is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ScheduleCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... schedule logic ...
    }
}
----
[NOTE]
Adding of `schedules` into the AddressBook can be done in natural language.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `schedule` operation works:

image::ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.1 : Sequence Diagram of Schedule Operation_

When the user calls ‘schedule’ or ‘sch’ to schedule the contacts in cherBook, the Model will receive a schedule from the Parser.

Upon successful scheduling, contacts are added into the `set of schedules`.
If one or more arguments required to schedule a person is missing, the AddressBook will return with error messages corresponding to the missing arguments.
If one or more arguments required to schedule a person is invalid, the AddressBook will return with error messages corresponding to the invalid arguments.

The following will show how the `schedule` is added into the AddressBook:
[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Adds a schedule for a student's consultation
     */
    @Override
    public void addSchedule(Schedule schedule) {
        addressBook.addSchedule(schedule);
        addressBook.sortSchedules();
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
        indicateScheduleListChanged();
    }
----
It is implemented this way to ensure that all `schedules` are added into the AddressBook with the lowest level of abstraction.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `ScheduleCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ScheduleCommand` inherits from Command. +
**Pros:** After scheduling the contacts, the schedules remain in the order they are entered into the AddressBook. +
**Cons:** The user is unable to sort the list of schedules according to chronological order. +
**Alternative 2:** `ScheduleCommand` inherits from Command. +
**Pros:** After scheduling the contacts, the schedules remain in the order they are entered into the AddressBook. +
**Cons:** The user is unable to sort the list of schedules according to chronological order. +

---

**Aspect:** How `schedule` executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adds a `schedule` into the `schedules list` once the person name and calendar date is parsed. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Vigorous user testing and logging is required to debug corner test cases because there is little control over imported APIs. +

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the `schedule` command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The list of schedules is altered directly from cherBook and is a standalone class. +
**Pros:** Without association with any other classes, it is easy to implement and debug. Performance of program is fast because the list of schedules is retrieved directly from cherBook.  +
**Cons:** The user would not be able to view information of the schedules directly from each contact. +
**Alternative 2:** Add each schedule into the contact as an attribute.  +
**Pros:** The user would be able to view the schedules directly from the respective contacts. +
**Cons:** Performance of program would be affected, because to retrieve the whole list of schedules, the algorithm would have to iterate through all the contacts in cherBook. +

// end::scheduleimplementation[]

=== View Schedule mechanism
// tag::viewschedulereason[]
The `viewschedule` mechanism is implemented using `ViewScheduleCommand`. It displays the schedules of the user of cherBook.
The reason for the implementation of viewing schedules is to allow cherBook users (teacher/educator) to keep track of their schedules as they often have many consultations or meetings with their students or fellow colleagues.
With this view schedule command, users are able to view all their schedules at once, sorted by date and time.
This way, the user is able to maintain their timetable easily.
// end::viewschedulereason[]

// tag::viewscheduleimplementation[]
When the user calls to view all the schedules, the `'Model'` component would return with the set of schedules that was previously added into cherBook.

ViewScheduleCommand is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ViewScheduleCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... view schedule logic ...
    }
}
----
The schedules would be listed in the `ResultDisplay` panel, and each schedule would be separated with a new line.

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the `ViewSchedule` command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The list of schedules is obtained directly from the `Model` before it is being displayed on the `ResultDisplay` panel. +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement and debug. Performance of program is fast because the list of schedules is retrieved directly from the `Model`.  +
**Cons:** The user do not have the alternative to view information of the schedules from each individual contact. +
// end::viewscheduleimplementation[]


//tag::home[]
=== Home Page mechanism
`Home` mechanism is implemented using HomeCommand.
It displays the home page when the user enter the command and each time a randomly selected wallpaper and quote would be displayed.

When the home page is displayed, the extendedPersonCard, StatsPanel and GraphPanel would be switched out. Only when the user
select a new person would the three panes swap back.

[NOTE]
As we would be focusing on CLI implementations, we did not enable a way to select a person through clicking when the home page
is displayed.

image::HomeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.9.1 : Sequence Diagram of `home` Operation_

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:**  To have a soft security feature. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Disable easy access to data, only users who knows the command are able to view. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Easier to be break through  +
**Alternative 2:** Have a login page before displaying the main window. +
**Pros:** The application as a whole would be more secure. +
**Cons:** Takes a longer time to implement. +
---

//end::home[]


// tag::graphpanel[]
=== GraphPanel Mechanism

`LineChart` mechanism is implemented using `javaFX`. It takes in `FilteredPersonList` and plots a graph based on those who are in the same `formClass`. +
Using `XYChart.series` to store the data of the persons name and grade, a `coordinate` is created and a `line` is drawn connecting all the `coordinates`. +
These coordinates are sorted in ascending order so that the user is able to identify those in the lower quartile.

The `LineChart` mechanism is implemented this way:

----

for (ReadOnlyPerson people : people) {
            if (people.getFormClass().equals(person.getFormClass())) {
                series.getData().add(new XYChart.Data<>(people.getName().toString(),
                        Double.parseDouble(people.getGrades().toString())));
            }
        }
            series.getData().sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(d -> d.getYValue()));
       //...other logic...
----

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Graph to be displayed for an effective visual aid +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Line chart to display the grades of student. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** May not be the most appropriate way to display grades of students.  +
**Alternative 2:** Bell curve to display the grades of students. +
**Pros:** A better representation of the student grades and it is easier to interpret. +
**Cons:** Much harder to plot a graph based on statistics then raw data.

---
// end::graphpanel[]


//tag::tab[]
=== Tabs mechanism
`Tabs` mechanism is implemented using TabsCommand.
It swaps tab panel between lineChart and barChart based on the index input by the user.

When the user types `tab [INDEX]`, it creates raises new `event` named `JumpToTabRequestEvent`, which prompts the subscribed
method in `GraphPanel` to change the tab page based on[INDEX].

[NOTE]
The number of valid index is based on the number of tabs created, in this case it would be 2. +
A invalid index would be displayed if the index provided is out of bounds.

image::TabSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.11.1 : Sequence Diagram of `Tab` Operation_

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:**  To display different chart types to help visual aid. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do a TabPane. +
**Pros:** More versatile and easier to further expand in the future. +
**Cons:** More cumbersome to start.  +
**Alternative 2:** Multiple graphs on the same pane. +
**Pros:** A easier comparison of the student grades between different graph types. +
**Cons:** Difficult to further expand as there are limited space. Graph may be shrinked as well.

---
//end::tab[]

// tag::statisticspanel[]
=== Statistics Panel mechanism

The `StatisticsPanel` class inherits from the `UiPart` class.
It displays to users the statistics of the current list of students in the `StudentsPanel` element of the user interface.

The `Statistics Panel` is implemented using the `Statistics` class and The `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` event.
The `Statistics` class supports the calculating of statistics for the current list of students in the `PersonListPanel` and
the `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` indicates that the FilteredPersonList in the model has changed and is used to update the `Statsistics Panel`.

The following activity diagram shows how the StatisticsPanel mechanism works:

image::StatisticsPanelActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.12.1 : Activity Diagram of updating the`Statistics Panel` ._

Whenever the user enters any `Command` that modifies the addressBook data, the `Model` Component posts
a `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` containing the `filteredPersonsList` to the `EventsCenter`.
At the same time, an `AddressBookChangedEvent` that indicates that the model has changed is also posted to the `EventsCenter`.

The `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` is implemented this way:

```
public class FilteredPersonListChangedEvent extends BaseEvent {

    private final ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> currentFilteredList;

    public FilteredPersonListChangedEvent(ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> currentFilteredList) {
        this.currentFilteredList = currentFilteredList;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.getClass().getSimpleName();
    }

    public ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> getCurrentFilteredPersonList() {
        return currentFilteredList;
    }
}
```

Meanwhile in the `StatisticsPanel` class, the `handleFilteredPersonListChangedEvent` event handler which is subscribed to `EventsCenter` handles the `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` event.

The `handleFilteredPersonListChangedEvent` event handler is implemented this way:

```
    @FXML
    @Subscribe
    private void handleFilteredPersonListChangedEvent(FilteredPersonListChangedEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        statistics.initScore(event.getCurrentFilteredPersonList()); // Updates the statistics instance values
        loadListStatistics();
    }
```

When handling the event, the `Statistics` instance in `StatisticsPanel` has its values updated by the `initScore()` method.
This means that the values returned from the `Statistics` class's getter methods when called are now updated.

The `loadListStatistics()` method in `StatisticsPanel` is then called.

The `loadListStatistics()` is implemented this way:

```
    /**
    * Updates list Statistics in the Statistics panel
    */
    protected void loadListStatistics() {
        mean.setText(statistics.getMeanString());
        median.setText(statistics.getMedianString());
        mode.setText(statistics.getModeString());
        variance.setText(statistics.getVarianceString());
        standardDeviation.setText(statistics.getStdDevString());
        quartile1.setText(statistics.getQuartile1String());
        quartile3.setText(statistics.getQuartile3String());
        interquartileRange.setText(statistics.getInterquartileRangeString());
    }
```

The `Labels` (texts) in the User Interface are set according to the updated `Statistics` instance's getter methods.
This updates and shows the statistic values of the current `filteredPersonList` on the `StatisticsPanel` in the User Interface.
At the same time, the `AddressBookChangedEvent` is also being handled, saving the addressBook data.

---

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How to update the `Statistics Panel` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` just for updating the `Statistics Panel`. +
**Pros:** Adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) increases cohesion among the different `Events` and reduces coupling. +
**Cons:** Increases the number of classes in the source code, making it more complex according to the More Is More Complex (MIMC) principle. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify `AddressBookChangedEvent` to also update the `Statistics Panel`. +
**Pros:** Since a change in the `model` triggers both the `AddressBookChangedEvent` and the updating of the `Statistics Panel`,
only a few changes to are needed for `AddressBookChangedEvent` to do also update the `Statistics Panel`. +
**Cons:** This violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by having giving `AddressBookChangedEvent` the additional responsibility of updating the `Statistics Panel`.  +

---

**Aspect:** How to raise the `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` in the `ModelManager` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate `updateStatisticsPanel()` method to raise the event to update the `Statistics Panel` +
**Pros:** Reduces coupling and increases cohesion by giving a single responsibility to the `updateStatisticsPanel()` method. +
**Cons:** Makes the application more complex to understand according to the More Is More Complex (MIMC) principle. +
**Alternative 2:** Raise the `FilteredPersonListChangedEvent` together with the `AddressBookChangedEvent` +
**Pros:** Reduces the number of similar methods in the source code, making it less complex and easier to understand +
**Cons:** Increases coupling in the source code +

---
// end::statisticspanel[]

// tag::uniquetagcolor[]
=== Unique Color Tag mechanism

The `unique color tag` mechanism is facilitated by making changes to `PersonCard` class in the `UI` component. This feature enables
the assignment of unique colors to tags.

The color generated to be assigned to tags is random and all tags with the same description will be assigned a same color.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `unique color tag` operation works:

image::UniqueTagColorSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.13.1 : Sequence Diagram of Unique Color Tag Operation_

The method receives `String tagName` (description of the tag) and returns the `String assignedColor`
associated to the tagName. It is shown in the code segment below.

----
public static String obtainTagColors(String tagName) {
        if (!currentTagColors.containsKey(tagName)) {
            do {
                Random random = new Random();
                final float hue = random.nextFloat();
                final float saturation = 0.65f + random.nextFloat()
                        * (0.90f - 0.65f);
                final float luminance = 0.60f + random.nextFloat()
                        * (0.90f - 0.60f);

                Color color = Color.getHSBColor(hue, saturation, luminance);

                Formatter hexRepresentation = new Formatter(new StringBuffer("#"));
                hexRepresentation.format("%02X", color.getRed());
                hexRepresentation.format("%02X", color.getGreen());
                hexRepresentation.format("%02X", color.getBlue());
                assignedColor = hexRepresentation.toString();
            } while (usedColors.contains(assignedColor));

            usedColors.add(assignedColor);
            currentTagColors.put(tagName, assignedColor);
        }
        return currentTagColors.get(tagName);
    }
----

The section below explains how various parts of the above code segment works.

A color is determined by three factors, `hue`, `saturation` and `luminance`.

image::HueSaturationLuminance.png[width="550"]
_Figure 4.13.2 : Color Range of Hue, Saturation and Luminance_

The code segment shown below randomises the value of each of the three factors,
and a random `color` is obtained.

----
Random random = new Random();

final float hue = random.nextFloat();
final float saturation = 0.65f + random.nextFloat() * (0.90f - 0.65f);
final float luminance = 0.60f + random.nextFloat() * (0.90f - 0.60f);

Color color = Color.getHSBColor(hue, saturation, luminance);
----

[NOTE]
Random range of `saturation` and `luminance` are tweaked to ensure that the random color generated will always mesh well with the white font of
the tag description.

image::tagColorPic.png[width="400"]
_Figure 4.13.3 : Compatibility of tag color background with white font of tag description_

Next, in the code segment below, the `red`, `green` and `blue` components are extracted from the `color`. It is then formatted into a `hexadecimal
representation` of the color, before being converted to a `String` data type and assigned to `assignedColor`.
[NOTE]
Hexadecimal representation of the color is compatible with JavaFx.

----
Formatter hexRepresentation = new Formatter(new StringBuffer("#"));
hexRepresentation.format("%02X", color.getRed());
hexRepresentation.format("%02X", color.getGreen());
hexRepresentation.format("%02X", color.getBlue());
assignedColor = hexRepresentation.toString();
----

The `assignedColor` is added into an `ArrayList<String> usedColors`. This ensures no same color will be assigned
to a tag with different description in subsequent iterations by randomising a different color again, should a same color is
generated. The method will then return `assignedColor`.

Lastly, in the code below, `obtainTagColors(tag.tagName)`, the hexadecimal String representation of the color, will be appended
to the tag background color. This sets the background color of the tag to be that of the assigned color.
----
private void initialiseTags(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        person.getTags().forEach(tag -> {
            Label tagLabel = new Label(tag.tagName);

            tagLabel.setStyle("-fx-background-color: " + obtainTagColors(tag.tagName));
            tags.getChildren().add(tagLabel);
        });
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: How tag colors are assigned. +
Alternative 1 (current choice): Tag colors are assigned randomly. +
Pros: Easy for developers to understand the mechanism of this feature. +
Cons: User has no control over the assigning of tag colors. +
Alternative 2: Tag colors are assigned by the user. +
Pros: User will have more freedom in personalising the tags. +
Cons: The range of colors will be more limited. +
// end::uniquetagcolor[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Unused/Removed Features

In this section, you will see features/implementations that are removed before the release of the final version. They will be
accompanied by a link to their unused code should you need them for your future improvements of cherBook.

// tag::studentparentcontact[]
=== Add Student/Parent Phone Contact mechanism [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B2/main/blob/master/collated/unused/Lenaldnwj-unused.md[Functional code]]

The `student/parent phone contact` mechanism is facilitated by making changes
to the Phone class in the model component. It enables the input
of the phone contact information of the student and his/her parent.

To ensure consistency across the user inputs for add command, the user will have to input p/ student/(STUDENT_NUMBER) parent/(PARENT_NUMBER)
instead of p/ Student: (STUDENT_NUMBER) Parent: (PARENT_NUMBER).

The following sequence diagram shows how the `student/parent phone contact` operation works:

image::MultipleNumberSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.1 : Sequence Diagram of Student/Parent Phone Contact Operation_

The following method replaces `/` with `:`````, `s` with `S`, and `p` with `P` in the user input string
for appropriate presentation of `displayed person card phone information`:
[source,java]
----
public static String changeToAppropriateUiFormat(String value) {
        value = value.replace("/", ": ");
        value = value.replace("s", "S");
        value = value.replace("p", "P");
        return value;
    }
----
Validity of the `displayed person card phone information` is checked in the following method in the Phone class:
[source,java]
----
public static boolean isValidPhone(String test) {
        return test.matches(PHONE_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----
where the `PHONE_VALIDATION_REGEX` refers to:
[source,java]
----
public static final String PHONE_VALIDATION_REGEX =
"((Student: )(\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d)( Parent: )(\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d))|((Parent: )(\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d))";
----
The regex ensures that the string for `displayed person card phone information` adheres to the
correct format of `Student: (STUDENT_NUMBER) Parent: (PARENT_NUMBER)` or `Parent: (PARENT_NUMBER)` as it is optional to
add the phone number of students.

The phone numbers must be exactly `8 digits` long.

image::PhoneDisplay.png[width="400"]
_Figure 5.1.2 : Valid Displayed Person Card Phone Information_

If the string format for `displayed person card phone information` is valid, the
phone contact information of the student and his/her parent will be displayed
below the student's name in the person card as seen in the figure above.

image::message_constraint.png[width="1100"]
_Figure 5.1.3 : Message to prompt Users to Enter Correct Phone Format_

If the string format for `displayed person card phone information` is invalid, an `IllegalValueException`
is thrown. The user will be prompted to follow the accepted format as seen in the figure above.
[source,java]
----
public Phone(String phone) throws IllegalValueException {
        requireNonNull(phone);
        String trimmedPhone = phone.trim();
        trimmedPhone = changeToAppropriateUiFormat(trimmedPhone);
        if (!isValidPhone(trimmedPhone)) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_PHONE_CONSTRAINTS);
        }
        this.value = trimmedPhone;
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Phone numbers  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Both the student's phone number and their parent's phone number is a single string. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement as separate classes for student's phone and parent's phone is not required. +
**Cons:** Harder to implement features that require solely the student's number or parent's number. +
**Alternative 2:** Have a phoneStudent class for student's phone number and phoneParent class for parent's phone number. +
**Pros:** Can edit properties of the student's phone number or parent's phone number separately. +
**Cons:** Harder to implement as now there will be two phone classes instead of one. +

---

**Aspect:** Validity of phone number +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow numbers that are exactly `8 digits` long. +
**Pros:** Ensures consistency across all phone numbers. +
**Cons:** Student's parents might not have foreign numbers that are not exactly `8 digits` long. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify phone validity regex to allow any length of phone numbers. +
**Pros:** Able to have phone numbers that are local or non-local. +
**Cons:** Inconsistent phone lengths displayed, might look very messy. +

== Documentation

In this section, we will be explaining how we edit and publish our documentation. We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
Asciidoc is chosen over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

You can look at <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

You can look at <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] is used for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

Having integrated unit tests that cover your API's behaviour is important.
It helps you verify the correctness, functional behaviour and usability of cherBook the app before you release it publicly.
This section details the different types of tests cherBook uses and how to run them.
Additionally, the troubleshooting section details the errors you might face while testing cherBook and different ways to solve them.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the third method. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ link:#JUnit[JUnit] test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

The https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use allows our GUI tests to be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. Thus, the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources` by opening `cmd` in the `cherBook directory` and
 inserting the line `gradlew processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section teaches you about tools building and provides you with instructions on how to test and release apps faster and	more efficiently.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started [[suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started]]

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a link:#Shorthand-Commands[shorthand] equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
