== Introduction

Welcome to _ScheduBook_! The aim of __ScheduBook __is to allow users with busy and hectic schedules to better plan meetings and be reminded of high priority meetings, in addition to the conventional AddressBook functionalities.
Upon starting the application, a Graphical User Interface that is completely functional using a command-line interface will be launched.

This developer guide is intended get you up-and-running with our application. We will cover everything you need to know,
from setting up, to the implementation of commands, to troubleshooting testing. This guide is written in a top-down approach which will help you to better understand the overall design
before diving into the detailed explanation of each component.

== Contribution
There are plenty of ways for you to contribute to this project such as (list is not exhaustive):

* Implementing new features
* Enhancing overall code quality
* Integrating external Application Programming Interfaces(API)
* Testing of codes

You do not have to worry about being an inexperienced programmer as this guide will not only will help you to get started as a __ScheduBook __contributor,
but also allow you to learn and understand the basic concepts behind Object-oriented programming(OOP) in Java.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `MeetingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` and `ObservableList<ReadOnlyMeeting>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.1 : Inheritance Diagram for commands_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.2 : Diagram to show stack_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.3 : Diagram to show stack with another command_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.3 : Diagram to show how undo works_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.4 : Sequence diagram for undo_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.5 : Diagram to show stack with more commands_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.6 : Diagram to show undoable command not added to stack_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 5.1.7 : Activity diagram to show UndoRedoStack_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
// tag::meetingClass[]

=== Implementing Meeting Class

The Meeting class is a new class just like the Person class, which resides inside `model`. It features commands that modifies the state of the address book
such as `addmeeting`, `deletemeeting`, `editmeeting`, `listmeeting` and `findmeeting`.
The attributes of Meeting class include `NameMeeting`, `DateTime`, `Place`, `Persons` and `MeetingTag`, as seen in the figure below.

image::MeetingCLass.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.4.1 Meeting Class_

`Persons` are `ReadOnlyPerson` class from the contact list added by the users. In this meeting class, `List<ReadOnlyPerson> personsToMeet` are an object inside `Meeting` class which stores the information of the persons inside the class itself.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Creation of Meeting class +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Input a person class in Meeting class to retrieve their name and phone number +
**Pros:** Allows developers to be more flexible to implement with meeting class, also simplify the creation of group meetings  +
**Cons:** It is difficult to implement.
**Alternative 2:** Meeting class that is created with 'PersonToMeet' and 'PhoneNum' class +
**Pros:** Easy to implement +
**Cons:** More codes for developers to write and change.
//end::meetingClass[]

// tag::addmeeting[]
=== Add Meeting

The add meeting command inherits from UndoableCommand which allows user to add meeting with the following parameters: 'INDEX' of person in the last person listing,
'Name' of Meeting, 'Date and Time' of Meeting, 'Location' of Meeting, and lastly, 'Importance' of Meeting.

Implementation:

When the `addmeeting` command is called with the appropriate parameters, an instance of the `Meeting` object is created with the
corresponding parameters. For example,

[source,java]
----
addmeeting 7 n/Shopping d/31-10-2017 16:00 l/Hillion Mall t/1
----

Creates an object with the following parameters
[source,java]
----
MeetingName: Shopping
DateTime: 31-10-2017 16:00
PersonName: Alex Yeo
PhoneNum: 87438807
Location: Hillion Mall
MeetingTag: 1
----

Furthermore, the `INDEX` of person provided would allow the newly-created `Meeting` object to get the name as well as phone number
of the corresponding contact as shown in the example above.

The following sequence diagram below shows how AddMeeting operation works:

image::addMeetingSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.1 : Sequence diagram of Add Meeting_

// end::addmeeting[]

// tag::deletemeeting[]
=== Delete Meeting

The delete meeting command inherits from UndoableCommand which allows user to delete meeting with the following parameters: 'INDEX' of meeting in the meeting list.

Implementation:

When the `deletemeeting` command is called with the appropriate parameters, the instance of the `Meeting` object created during addmeeting
is called upon and removed.
For example,

[source,java]
----
deletemeeting 1
----

Deletes an object with the following parameters
[source,java]
----
INDEX: 1
----

The `INDEX` of meeting provides the name, date and location of the meeting which is used to remove it
from the meeting list.

// end::deletemeeting[]

// tag::findmeeting[]
=== Find Meeting

The find meeting command inherits from Command which allows users to find meeting with the following parameters: [KEYWORD] of the meeting in the meeting list.

Implementation:

When the `findmeeting` command is called with the appropriate parameters, a search for the instance of the `Meeting` object created during addmeeting
with keywords are listed.
For example,

[source,java]
----
findmeeting makan
----

Finds an object with the following parameters
[source,java]
----
KEYWORD: makan
----

The `KEYWORD` of meeting provides the name, date and location of the meeting which is used to list it.

If none of the meetings contains the `KEYWORD`, the results would show "No meetings found".
// end::findmeeting[]

// tag::findexactmeeting[]
=== Find Exact Meeting

The find exact meeting command inherits from Command which allows users to find meetings in the meeting list with persons whose name matches the [PHRASE].

Implementation:

When the `findexactmeeting` command is called with the appropriate parameters, a search for the instance of the `Meeting` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the command works:

image::FindExactMeetingSequence.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.8.1 : Find Exact Meeting Sequence Diagram_

For example,

[source,java]
----
findexactmeeting john tan
----

Finds a meeting(s) with the following parameter as the name of the person stored in meeting
[source,java]
----
PHRASE: john tan
----

If none of the meetings contains the `PHRASE`, the results would show "No meetings found".

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to narrow down search results +
**Alternative 1:** reducing the number of search results when more keywords are added +
**Pros:** Allows more flexibility when searching for a specific meeting +
**Cons** Might not be able to sufficiently narrow down search results when there is a large amount of meetings stored

**Current Choice :** Searching based on the entire name of a person +
**Pros:** Able to significantly reduce the amount of meetings listed +
**Cons** Restricts user to only search using one field


---
// end::findexactmeeting[]

// tag::editmeeting[]
=== Edit Meeting

The edit meeting command is an undoable command which allows the user to edit the `MeetingName`, `DateTime` or `Place` of
a created `Meeting` object.

Implementation:

When the `editmeeting` command is called with the appropriate parameters given, an instance of the `Meeting` object is created
with the corresponding parameters. For example,

[source,java]
----
editmeeting 2 n/Lunch l/Jurong East Mall
----

Creates an object with the following parameters
[source,java]
----
MeetingName:Lunch
DateTime: null
Place: Jurong East Mall
----

This instance of the object `Meeting` is then compared to the preexisting `Meetings` in the addressbook corresponding
to the index that was given in the command line which for the example above is `Index` 2. The respective parameters
will then be replaced accordingly with the ones that were instantiated. As shown also, parameters that were not declared
(in the case of the example, it was DateTime), are defaulted to be null and will not be changed in the actual `Meeting`
object.

When given invalid inputs, the `editmeeting` command shares some of the  exceptions
which are also thrown by the `addmeeting` command. They are:

* `DuplicateMeetingException`: Compares the edited Meeting object with the other Meeting objects in the address book
and this exception is thrown when there is a duplicate object with the same parameters.
* `MeetingNotFoundException` : Exception is thrown when the index provided to the `editmeeting` command
is referring to the invalid index of a `Meeting` object in the addressbook
* `MeetingBeforeCurrDateException` : Exception is thrown when the date of the edited
Meeting is earlier than that of the current system time, this exception is thrown.
* `MeetingClashException` : Exception is thrown when the DateTime of the editedmeeting is
the same as one of the preexisting Meetings in the addressbook.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** how `EditMeetingCommand` executes +
**Alternative 1 :** Comparing the different parameters individually without the creation
 of a new instance of a `Meeting` +
**Pros:** More direct and faster way of editing the different parameters of the `Meeting` object +

---
// end::editmeeting[]


=== Edit Meeting

The edit meeting command is an undoable command which allows the user to edit the `MeetingName`, `DateTime` or `Place` of
a created `Meeting` object.

Implementation:

When the `editmeeting` command is called with the appropriate parameters given, an instance of the `Meeting` object is created
with the corresponding parameters. For example,

[source,java]
----
editmeeting 2 n/Lunch l/Jurong East Mall
----

Creates an object with the following parameters
[source,java]
----
MeetingName:Lunch
DateTime: null
Place: Jurong East Mall
----

This instance of the object `Meeting` is then compared to the preexisting `Meetings` in the addressbook corresponding
to the index that was given in the command line which for the example above is `Index` 2. The respective parameters
will then be replaced accordingly with the ones that were instantiated. As shown also, parameters that were not declared
(in the case of the example, it was DateTime), are defaulted to be null and will not be changed in the actual `Meeting`
object.

When given invalid inputs, the `editmeeting` command shares some of the  exceptions
which are also thrown by the `addmeeting` command. They are:

* `DuplicateMeetingException`: Compares the edited Meeting object with the other Meeting objects in the address book
and this exception is thrown when there is a duplicate object with the same parameters.
* `MeetingNotFoundException` : Exception is thrown when the index provided to the `editmeeting` command
is referring to the invalid index of a `Meeting` object in the addressbook
* `MeetingBeforeCurrDateException` : Exception is thrown when the date of the edited
Meeting is earlier than that of the current system time, this exception is thrown.
* `MeetingClashException` : Exception is thrown when the DateTime of the editedmeeting is
the same as one of the preexisting Meetings in the addressbook.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** how `EditMeetingCommand` executes +
**Alternative 1:** Comparing the different parameters individually without the creation
 of a new instance of a `Meeting` +
**Pros:** More direct and faster way of editing the different parameters of the `Meeting` object +
**Cons:** Unable to check for invalid fields of later inputs

**Current Choice:** Creating a new edited meeting object before modifying the one in the database. +
**Pros:** Able to check if edited fields are valid +
**Cons:** Involves the creation of new objects, possibly longer run time

// tag::selectmeeting[]

=== Select Meeting

The select meeting command inherits from Command which allows user to select a meeting with the following parameters:
'INDEX' of meeting in the last meeting listing.

Implementation:

When the `selectmeeting` is called with the appropriate parameters given, the Events center would create and post an instance of this as a new request event.
This request event is then handled by the Browser Panel which loads the designated meeting page, Google Maps, with the meeting location loaded into the
destination.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Purpose and use for selecting a meeting +
**Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Google Maps is loaded in the browser panel +
**Pros:** Allows developer to make use of the already established Google Maps. +
**Cons:** Requires user to input valid addresses instead of user-based inputs like "Alex's Home". +
**Alternative 2 (future option):** Allows user to choose what to load at the browser panel such as connecting to social media platforms to interact with meeting partners +
**Pros:** Improve flexibility and choices to suit different needs of users.

// end::selectmeeting[]

// tag::meetingCard[]
=== Meeting Card

The implementation of meeting card starts of from creating 'Meeting' class which resides in the Model component of this application. This meeting card also requires the UI component for this cards to be properly shown to the users.

* Firstly, the Meeting class is created with object properties like `MeetingName`, `DateTime`, `Place`, `PersonToMeet` and `PhoneNum` . We want all these object properties to facilitate the users' ability to retrieve these information of his/her scheduled meeting. This is handled by ModelManager.
* These object properties of the meeting class are assigned to the labels in the Meeting card of MeetingCard.java, handled by UI manager.

_Figure 5.12.1 : Sequence diagram of Ui of Meeting Card_

* The list of meeting cards are assigned to the panel at the right of the program. The list are created with 'UniqueMeetingList'. This list of meetings are always sorted according to date and time, with the nearest date and time first. The implementation of the sorting of this `Meeting` cards is by using lambda sort, where the `LocalDateTime` of the `DateTime` in `Meeting` are sorted.

image::MeetingCard.png[width="250"]
_Figure 5.12.2 : Meeting Card_

To show the urgency of the meeting, as you can see from the examples below, colours are assigned to the card by comparing the date and time in the meeting class to the date and time of the log in.

* `darkRed` : Meeting is in next 24 hours.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Ways to be implemented as a reminder of the urgency of the meeting +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Colour is applied to meeting card +
**Pros:** Easy to implement but further developers can enhance the colors easily. +
**Cons:** Might not be as appealing to some users. +
**Alternative 2 (future choice):** A pop-up reminder to show meeting on the current day and with the colours applied to meeting card +
**Pros:** Will be a better reminder to users.
// end::meetingCard[]

// tag::meetingPopup[]
=== Meeting pop up reminder

To maximise the ability to remind the users of their meetings, a pop up reminder with the details of the meetings are shown to the user. The user will just have to acknowledge it. The pop up reminder activates and provides the details of the users' next meeting in 24 hours. As you can see from the Figure 5.8.1, there are sufficient details of the next meeting and the extra button is for the user to confirm the reminder.

image::Reminder.png[width="600"]
_Figure 5.13.1 : Reminder for single meeting_

Implementation: +
The creation of the pop up starts if there is a meeting on the day itself by the calling of `MeetingAlert` class during the opening of the application. The implementation of meeting pop up reminder ultilises `javafx.stage.Stage`. Before the instantiation of the `MeetingAlert` class, there will be a check if the next meeting is a group meeting or normal meeting. Subsequently, the results will be shown on the reminder itself, shown in Figure 5.8.2.

_Figure 5.13.2 : Reminder for group meeting_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Ways to be implemented as a reminder of the urgency of the meeting +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** A pop-up reminder to show meeting on the current day, furthermore working with the colours applied to meeting card +
**Pros:** Will be a better reminder to users and easy to implement +
**Cons:** Might not be as appealing to some users. +
**Alternative 2 :** Scrap the colours indicators for individual cards +
**Pros:** Might be more appealing to some users. +
**Cons:** Colour cards itself might not be significant enough to remind the users
// end::meetingPopup[]

// tag::autoDelete[]
=== Automatic Deletions of Meetings
Since, meetings that have been attended or missed are not needed in the meeting reminders anymore, we found a need for _ScheduBook_ to manage the meetings and delete them, without the need for user to manually delete them.

Implementation: +
When _ScheduBook_ is being booted up, the application loads up `addressbook`.xml file which stores the record of the saved file from the previous boot up of _ScheduBook_. Hence, using `LocalDateTime` classes and methods, any meetings that have dates before the time the user boot up _ScheduBook_ will not be added to the `filteredMeetingList` that is used to replace the pre-loaded list as you can see in the code snippet below. Hence, the newest list will not include those meetings and further saved back to the `addressbook`.xml file when user shut down _ScheduBook_.

----
for (final ReadOnlyMeeting meeting : meetings) {
            if (dateIsAfter((meeting.getDate().toString()))) {
            //to delete meetings that have passed automatically
                replacement.add(new Meeting(meeting));
            }
        }
----

----
private boolean dateIsAfter (String date) {
        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm");
        LocalDateTime currDate = LocalDateTime.now();
        LocalDateTime meetDate = LocalDateTime.parse(date, formatter);
        if (meetDate.isAfter((currDate))) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Ways to handle meetings that have passed the scheduled date and time +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Application automatically deletes all meetings that have passed the scheduled time +
**Pros:** User-friendly, past meetings will not obstruct the user's usage, hence being more organised +
**Cons:** Some users might want to save some meetings that they missed +
**Alternative 2 (future choice) :** Have an extra tabs that stores and saves meetings that user indicates to +
**Pros:** Satisfy the need for some user to store 'missed' meetings +
**Alternative 3 :** Let the users handle the meetings themselves +
**Pros:** More freedom of choice, to manage the meetings +
**Cons:** More troublesome for users, less user-friendly

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
