== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` and `ObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::googleimplementation[]
=== Google Implementation

Contact’em now incorporates and integrates Google Contacts and Gmail which will enhance its usability. Firstly,
`Login Command` is implemented so that the Contact’em can authenticate with the google servers when the user has successfully logged in.
The new `GoogleAuthenticator` class is created to run the authentication process.

The `Login Command` sequence diagram is as follows:

image::LoginSequence.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Login command sequence diagram_

The login page will be loaded in the browser panel after the login command has successfully executed. This is for the user to authenticate with google. Contact’em will then redirect the user to the Google contacts web page after successful authentication.

==== GoogleContactsBuilder class and GoogleID attribute
The `GoogleContactsBuilder` class can be instantiated to access the list of contacts from Google and also to obtain the `PeopleService` object needed to modify the contacts in Google. This is done by making use of the methods in the `GoogleAuthenticator` object to obtain the access token and `PeopleService` from Google.

The token required for authentication is obtained from the redirect url after logging in. This means that the user must stay on the Google contacts page in the browser panel when instantiating this class (For import / export / sync
commands). The class diagram for `GoogleContactsBuilder` is shown below.

image::Class diagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.1 : GoogleContactsBuilder class diagram_

Every Person in the address book now has a new attribute known as the GoogleID. This ID refers to its own GoogleID in Google contacts. Contacts that are not synchronised with Google will have a null GoogleID.

==== Import Command
After successful authentication, the user can proceed to import contacts from his google account. The import command creates a `GoogleContactsBuilder` object to retrieve the list of google contacts from the server.

The `Import command` sequence diagram is as follows:

image::Import command.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2.1 : Import command sequence diagram_

When the command is executed, the list of Google contacts will be looped through and compared with the contacts in Contact’em. If the GoogleID of a particular Google contact is not found in Contact’em, the contact will be imported. This is represented by the code snippet as shown below.

`Pseudo-code snippet:`
[source,java]
----
for each contact: googleContactsList {
    if contact does not exists in Contact’em
               model.addPerson(newPerson(contact))
}
----

`Scenario 1`

The newPerson(...) method shown in the above code snippet successfully creates a Person object using attributes from the Google contact and it will be added to the address book. The GoogleID of the contact will also be instantiated within the new Person Object. The Person will also be given a GoogleContact Tag.

`Scenario 2`

The newPerson(...) method fails to create a Person object from the Google contact. The Google contact will fail to import. Reasons for the above mentioned failure includes, +
1) Google contact might have invalid attributes. Eg: Invalid email format +
2) Google contact might not have all attributes required to create a new Person object.
	All the following attributes must be present: Name, Phone, Email and Address.

A message detailing the result of the command will be displayed to inform the user on the number of contacts imported or the number of contacts along with a string of names of contacts that failed to import.

==== Export Command
After successful authentication, the user can next proceed to export contacts from Contact’em into his google account. The command creates a GoogleContactsBuilder object to retrieve peopleService from google which is required to modify/add contacts in Google.

The `Export command` sequence diagram is as follows:

image::Export Command.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3.1 : Export command sequence diagram_

When the command is executed, the list of contacts in Contact’em will be looped through to check whether they are a google contact. If they are not, they will be exported to Google contacts. This is represented by the code snippet shown below.

**Pseudo-code snippet**
[source,java]
----
for each contact: addressBookList{
    if contact does not have a GoogleContact Tag
               New googleContact = createGoogleContact (contact);
               googleContact = builder.getPeopleService().people() createContact(googleContact).
                                            execute();
               model.updatePerson(contact, newAddressBookContact(contact));
}
----

`Scenario 1`

The createGoogleContact method shown in the above code snippet successfully creates a GooglePerson that will be exported to Google contacts. The export command will then update the contact by instantiating its GoogleID attribute retrieved from the newly created Google contact and adding a GoogleContacts tag to it.

`Scenario 2`

The contact might not be exported to Google due to the failure in connecting to Google servers. This is can be due to token expiring.

A message detailing the result of the command will be displayed to inform the user on the number of contacts imported or failed to import.

==== Sync Command
After successful authentication, the user can proceed to sync contacts in Contact’em. The sync command creates a GoogleContactsBuilder object to retrieve the list of Google contacts from the server. In this case, the contacts in Google contacts takes higher precedence and any changes to them will be updated to the contacts in Contact’em when the user syncs. However, any changes made to the contacts in the Contact’em will not be transferred to Google contacts when the user syncs but instead, its attribute will be restored to its original value.

The `Sync command` sequence diagram is as follows:

image::Sync Command.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.4.1 : Sync command sequence diagram_

When the command is executed, the list of contacts in Contact’em will be looped through to check if they exists within the list of Google contacts. If they are, a Person object based on the Google contact will be created and it will be used to compare with the contact in the Contact'em. This is represented by the code snippet shown below.

`Pseudo-code snippet:`
[source,java]
----
for each contact: addressBookList{
    for each googlecontact : googleContactsList{
               if contact shares a similar googleID with the googlecontact
               exists = true;
                          if convertToAddress(googlecontact) is not the same as contact
                                    model.updatePerson(contact, convertToAddress(googlecontact))
     }
    if contact is a google contact but exists == false
                model.updatePerson(contact, removeGoogleContactStatus(contact));
}
----

`Scenario 1`

The attributes of the contact are the same as itself in Google contacts. No synchronising will be done on that contact.

`Scenario 2`

The attributes of the contact are different from itself in Google contacts. A newly created contact will replace the previous contact as shown in the above code snippet in model.updatePerson(...).

`Scenario 3`

The format of the Google contact is invalid and hence no new Person is created for comparison with the contact in Contact’em. The contact in the Contact’em will not be synchronised.

`Scenario 4`

The contact in the Contact’em is thought to exist in Google contacts but is not found. The removeGoogleContactStatus() method shown in the above code snippet will remove the Google contact status of the contact.

A message detailing the result of the command will be displayed to inform the user on the number of contacts synced and the number of contacts along with a string of names of contacts that failed to sync.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storage of access token. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users have to be on the Google contact web page in order to use the following commands : `Import`, `Export`, `Sync`. This is because the token is retrieved from the url every time the user uses the above mentioned commands. +
**Pros:** Users will be able to inspect the contacts within the Google contacts and they will be able to update the contacts if the contacts fail to import or synchronise by referring to the warning messages displayed. +
**Cons:** This might cause some inconvenience because the users have to re-login to use the above mentioned commands if they have switched pages in the browser panel. +
**Alternative 2:** Stores the token within the program once the user has logged in. +
**Pros:** More convenience for user as they do not have to stay on the Google contacts page whenever they want to use the above mentioned commands. +
**Cons:** In the case when some contacts fail to synchronise or import, the user have to re-login anyway to check on the contacts in google. By doing so, the error message produced earlier on will be removed and the user does not have a reference to see which contact is not importing or synchronising. +

---

**Aspect:** Precedence of Google contacts over Contact’em contacts in sync command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Google contacts takes higher precedence. Contacts updated in Google contacts will be synchronised to Contact'em. +
**Pros:** This alternative allow users to update contacts in Google contacts on-the-go which can be synchronised to Contact’em next time they use it. +
**Cons:** Contacts updated in Contact’em must be manually updated in the Google contacts as well. If not, next time when the user synchronises Contact'em, the changes will be removed. +
**Alternative 2:** Contact’em takes higher precedence. Contacts updated in Contact’em will be synchronised to Google contacts. +
**Pros:** This is better for user who uses Contact’em  more often than Google contacts. For some, the contacts in Google contacts might just be an on-the-go reference and most updating is done within Contact’em. +
**Cons:** Will not be able to update contacts if they are away from the computer.
// end::googleimplementation[]


// tag::EasyFind[]
=== EasyFind mechanism

The EasyFind mechanism is an action driven task, which activates when the user tries to search for a contact by updating the search results whenever the user inputs a letter into the command box.

The mechanism is facilitated by a new command `FindLettersCommand` which will search for contacts matching the letters in the command box. The command is called every time the user inputs or remove a character from the command box while using the command `Find`.

The key release event of the command box is constantly searching for the term `find` and when the user inputs the mentioned term into the command box, the key release event will begin searching for contacts by passing the letters entered after the term `find` into `FindLettersCommand`.

The application will display the number of contacts that share the same letters as the input.


[NOTE]
After the user inputs `enter`, normal find command will be executed
[NOTE]
EasyFind mechanism is case insensitive

The following sequence diagram shows how the `FindLettersCommand` works:

image::FindLettersCommand.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : FindLettersCommand sequence diagram_


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Intertwining of `FindLettersCommand` and `FindCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate both commands. +
**Pros:** We will not lose the original functionality of the `FindCommand` and creating a new `FindLettersCommand` allows the application to search for contacts more frequently when the EasyFind mechanism is activated. +
**Cons:** This might confuse the user as the `FindCommand` and `FindLettersCommand` could generate different results. The contact that the user is searching for may be displayed when a partial name is inputted. However, when the user inputs `enter` before typing in the full name, the displayed contact will be removed by the original `FindCommand` +
**Alternative 2:** Replace `FindCommand` with `FindLettersCommand` +
**Pros:** The results displayed will not change even after the user has pressed `enter`. It can also help the user to speed up the process of searching for contacts as they user does not have to input the full name +
**Cons:** Removing the find Command may affect other functions of Contact'em.
// end::EasyFind[]


// tag::findbytags[]
=== Finding Contacts by Tags

The application allows users to find contacts based on their tags. The command word is `findtags`, and the alternatives are `findtag` and `ft`. The following subsections explain how the program is supposed to function given this command, and how it is implemented.

==== User Inputs and Expected Actions/Results

There are three ways to use this command. Some pseudo-code is provided for each of these 3 scenarios to aid understanding.

**Scenario 1**

In the first scenario, also the most basic, the user only specifies tags to **include**. For this, the program should simply return all contacts that have at least one of the tags.

**Example Command 1:** findtags friends +
Expected result: returns contacts that are tagged “friends”.

**Pseudo-code snippet**
[source,java]
----
for each tag : contact.getTagList {
    if (keywordsToInclude.hasAnyMatchingWordsWith(tag.value)) {
        return true;
    }
}
return false;
----

**Scenario 2**

In the second scenario, the user only specifies tags to **exclude**. To specify a tag to exclude, user includes a hyphen "-"  before the keyword to be excluded. In this case, the program should return all contacts that do not have any of these tags to be excluded.

Note that this includes contacts with no tags.


**Example Command 2:** findtags -colleagues +
Expected result: returns all contacts not tagged “colleagues”.

**Pseudo-code snippet**
[source,java]
----
for each tag : contact.getTagList {
    if (keywordsToExclude.hasAnyMatchingWordsWith(tag.value)) {
        return false;
    }
}
return true;
----

**Scenario 3**

In the third scenario, the user specifies **both tags to include and exclude**. The program will return all contacts that have: +
1) ANY of the tags to include. +
2) NONE of the tags to exclude.

**Example Command 3:** findtags friends -colleagues +
Expected result: returns all contacts tagged “friends” but not tagged “colleagues”.

**Pseudo-code snippet:**
[source,java]
----
boolean personHasAtLeastOneMatchingTag = false;

for each tag : contact.getTagList {
     if keywordsToExclude.hasAnyMatchingWordsWith(tag.value)
                return false;
     if keywordsToInclude.hasAnyMatchingWordsWith(person.getTagList()
                 personHasAtLeastOneMatchingTag = true;
}

if (personHasAtLeastOneMatchingTag)
      return true;
else
      return false;
----

[NOTE]
There must be at least one parameter specified, but the order of parameters entered does not matter.

==== Brief Overview of Command Procedure

3 diagrams are provided below to help illustrate a big picture view of the command.

===== Class Diagram:

image::FindTagsCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2.1 : Class Diagram of Find Tags Command_

Firstly, _Figure 3.3.2.1_ above is the class diagram of this command, which should
provide a basic understanding of the classes involved.


===== Activity Diagram:

image::findtags-activitydiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 3.3.2.2 : Brief Overview of Find Tags Command Procedure_

Secondly, _Figure 3.3.2.2_ above is the activity diagram of the command.
As you can see, the entire command consists of 4 main steps:

1) The parameters are parsed and deciphered. +
2) Using the deciphered information from step 1, the Predicate and Command are constructed. +
3) Command is executed. +
4) Predicate is called and the Model is updated.

More detailed explanations and elaborations are given in the subsections below.

===== Sequence Diagram:
image::FindContactsByTagsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2.3 : Findtags Sequence Diagram_

Last but not least, _Figure 3.3.2.3_ above shows the overall sequence diagram, to give a more detailed look into the steps taken
by the program to run the command.

==== Implementation of Parser

The parser associated with this command is **FindPersonsWithTagsCommandParser**, under **seedu.address.logic.parser**. Due to this parser’s long name, it will be referred to as the “command parser” or simply “parser” within this section to aid clarity.

When this command is invoked by the user, this command parser will be constructed by **AddressbookParser**, receiving the user’s input as a String parameter. The command parser deciphers the input, and eventually returns a **FindPersonsWithTagsCommand** for execution.

The command parser first checks if the arguments are valid. If the arguments are empty, a **ParseException** will be thrown for invalid arguments. If the arguments are valid (non-empty), they are split into individual keywords and stored in a String array tagKeywords.

image::StringToTagKeywords.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.3.1 : Splitting Up Keywords_


As the diagram above shows, the keywords are split by the spaces in between each word, and each of these words are stored in a String array **tagKeywords**.

The array of keywords is then passed into the parser’s private method, **getImprovedList()**, to retrieve a more comprehensive list of tags in addition to the original list of keywords.

[NOTE]
The details of **getImprovedList** are not crucially important to the functionality of the parser, and is thus omitted here, but included in the addendum in Section 3.3.6.

After obtaining the improved list, the parser constructs the command _Predicate_ (details in Section 3.3.4), and the _Command_ itself (details in the Section 3.3.5). Then it returns the _Command_ to **AddressbookParser** and then the **LogicManager** for execution.


==== Implementation of Predicate

The _Predicate_ associated with this functionality is called **PersonContainsTagsPredicate**, found in **seedu.address.model.person**.

This _Predicate_ has three attributes, _keywords_, which are generated in the _parser_, and 2 lists, _keywordsToInclude_ and _keywordsToExclude_. The 2 lists are generated from _keywords_.

After this _Predicate_ is constructed, it is used in the constructor of a **FindPersonsWithTagsCommand** and becomes that command’s attribute.

When the command is executed, this _Predicate_ will be called for every contact in the address book to determine if a contact should be filtered or not based on the user’s inputs.

To do so, the **test** method of this Predicate is used, which returns a Boolean value: true if this contact should be returned, and false otherwise.

Within this test method, the following steps occur, for each contact in the currently stored in the application:

image::findtags-pathdiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.4.1 : Findtags Predicate Activity Diagram_

As seem from _Figure 3.3.4.1_, firstly, all of the person’s tags, if any, are appended to a String **allTagNames**. For example, if a contact has tags "friends" and "colleagues", the resulting String is "friends colleagues".

Then, the comparison is made between **allTagNames** and the 2 lists generated in constructor, to return the appropriate Boolean value. Below is the code snippet used in the comparison. Note that this is not the only way to implement this comparison.

**Code Snippet:**
[source,java]
----
//For scenario 2
if (onlyKeywordsToExcludeAreSpecified) {
            return !(keywordsToExclude.stream()
                    .anyMatch((keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(allTagNames, keyword))));
}


//For scenarios 1 and 3
return keywordsToInclude.stream()
    .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(allTagNames, keyword)) &&
    !(keywordsToExclude.stream()
    .anyMatch((keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(allTagNames, keyword))));
----

==== Implementation of Command
The command executed in this feature is **FindPersonsWithTagsCommand**, found in **seedu.address.logic.commands**.

After the command parser returns the command to **AddressbookParser** and then to the **LogicManager**, assuming that no exceptions are thrown so far, the command is executed, by calling its **execute()** method.

In this **execute()** method, the current model invokes its **updateFilteredPersonList** method, with the command _Predicate_ as described above as its parameter.

This runs the **test()** method of the _Predicate_, which determines the appropriate contacts to filter. This causes the model to update accordingly and filters the contacts displayed in the UI.

Finally, this command returns a **CommandResult**, which includes the number of contacts being displayed. This value is displayed on the UI command box for the user’s reference.



==== Addendum

**Implementation of getImprovedList** +
In the command parser (as detailed in Section 3.3.3), there exists a private method **getImprovedList()**, which takes in the list of keywords entered by the user and attempts to return a more comprehensive one in addition to the original list, to account for grammatical differences in plural and singular forms of the keywords.

To give an example, if the keyword is “friend”, the extra keyword generated is “friends” and vice-versa. This works for “exclusion-keywords” (keywords with a dash in front) as well.

What is of note is that this method is merely a crude, quality-of-life improvement for the user. It simply generates the keywords by appending the letter ‘s’ to keywords which do not end with ‘s’, and removes ‘s’ from words that do end with the letter ‘s’.

As a result, it does not account for words where singular and plural forms differ by more than just a single letter ‘s’, such as “family” and “families”.

It is therefore recommended that future developers improve this method, perhaps by implementing a proper dictionary or library for this method, after weighing the costs and benefits. Alternatively, this idea could be further improved or refined on with a Lookup Table to save file storage space.

Nevertheless, this improvement is meant to increase user enjoyment and convenience. The onus of organising and spelling tags in an organised manner is still on the user. To that end,  if the case arises that, based on user feedback, this improvement does more harm than good, it is recommended that this feature be removed or made optional. However, this is not something that the current developers foresee will occur based on observation of how people in general spell their tags.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Improving list of keywords. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add 's' to letters that do not end with 's', and vice-versa. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and read. +
**Cons:** Does not account for all words in English, may have non-English words. +

**Alternative 2:** Import appropriate library for getting singular/plural words. +
**Pros:** More likely to account for all words. +
**Cons:** May impact performance. +

**Alternative 3:** Implement a Look-up Table. +
**Pros:** Can account for more words than alternative 1, and less impact on performance and storage than alternative 2. +
**Cons:** Might be difficult to implement and may not be as comprehensive as alternative 2. +

---

**Aspect**: Comparision of tag names and keywords in predicate. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice): **Append names to an empty String for comparision with keywords. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and change. +
**Cons:** Requires use of lambda, which may be more difficult to understand for beginners. +

**Alternative 2:** Compare tag against tag by encapsulating all keywords into Tags. +
**Pros:** Can use the equals specified in Tag, and/or comparator instead of lambda for better readability. +
**Cons:** More difficult to implement, and may create many tags that are never used because the keywords and expanded to improve user convenience (singular vs plural tag names). +

=== Birthdays

Users are able to store birthdays of their contacts by inputting in the format of ddMMyyyy when adding a person, using the prefix `b/`.

In general, the ability to store a person’s birthday was implemented by adding it to the component of `Person`.

=== Representation of birthdays

Storing of birthdays is facilitated by an immutable `Birthday` object, which is a component of `Person`.

The main classes that implement this attribute is: AddCommand, AddCommandParser, EditCommand, EditCommandParser, Person, PersonListCard.

However, birthday has been made to be an optional field to include while adding a new contact.

=== Validation of birthday

Birthday uses the DateFormat and the SimpleDateFormat packages to check if the birthday entered is a valid date.
For example, 31/02/1998 is not a valid date.

Validation of birthday is implemented this way:
[source,java]
---
public static boolean isValidBirthday(String test) {
    if (test.matches(BIRTHDAY_VALIDATION_REGEX)) {
        try {
            DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT);
            df.setLenient(false);
            df.parse(test);
            return true;
        } catch (ParseException pe) {
            return false;
        }
    } else if (test.matches("")) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
---

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Representation of birthdays +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display the birthday of the specified contact after the address of the contact +
**Pros:** It follows the format of the person card +
**Cons:** It is difficult to recognise the number displayed is the birthday as it is merely represented as an eight digit number +

**Alternative 2:** Display the birthday with "Birthday:" in front +
**Pros:** Simple and easy to understand +
**Cons:** Inconsistent with the format in person card

// end::birthday[]

// tag::listtags[]
=== Implementation of List Tags
The application allows users to see the list of all tags that are currently attached to contacts in the application. The command word is `listtags`, and
the shortcut alternative is `lt`. The follow subsections explain how the program is supposed to function given the command, and how it is implemented.

==== User Inputs and Expected Actions/Results
In general, when this command is used, there are only 2 scenarios that will occur.

**Scenario 1** +
There is at least 1 tag attached to at least 1 contact.

In this scenario, the application will show these tags in the result box.

Below is the format of the results: +
You have the following tags: [tag1] [tag2] [tag3] ...

**Scenario 2** +
There are no tags attached to any contacts in the application. This could happen if there are: +
1. No contacts in the application. +
2. No tags attached to any contact.

In this scenario, the application will show to user the following message: +
"You do not have any tags!"

==== Brief Overview of the Command
A brief overview of the steps taken by the application in producing the appropriate results is as given: +
1. Creates a list of tags by iterating through every Contact in the application and adding their tags to the list. +
2. Check if this list of tags is empty or not, that is, whether it is scenario 1 or scenario 2. +
2a. If it is scenario 2, that is, there are no tags to output, the command merely returns the failure message. +
3. If the list is not empty, it will output the success message along with the list of tags in the appropriate format. The details of this step is given
in the next subsection.

==== Implementation of Success Scenario
The steps taken are: +
1. Converts the list of Tags to a list of String containing the names of each Tag. +
2. Sorts the list in alphabetical order. +
3. Using a StringBuilder, appends the names to each other with the appropriate formatting. +
4. Output the result.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Order of Tags displayed +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display in alphabetical order. +
**Pros:** More readable and more easily understood. +
**Cons:** May not be the most meaningful. +

**Alternative 2:** Display based on how many of each tag there are, for example in ascending order. +
**Pros:** Might be more meaningful for certain users and cases. +
**Cons:** Much more difficult to implement, and may appear more confusing to users, as alphabetical order is generally more easily understood. +

**Alternative 3:** Allow option to display both in alphabetical order or in ascending order. +
**Pros:** Best of both worlds, allowing user to choose the most meaningful. +
**Cons:** Adding on to the already numerous commands may not be the most meaningful, especially when the main
function of this enhancement is to complement the find tags feature.

// end::listtags[]

=== Implementation of Facebook Field
Each contact can now support a Facebook field, which is displayed on the person card.

A few things to note about this field:

1. The Facebook field is not compulsory when adding to the application.

2. If user does not input the Facebook field, removes it using the edit command, it will be replaced by
the default Facebook homepage, "https://facebook.com/".

3. User can input Facebook field in 2 ways, the first is the entire link to the Facebook profile.
In this case, the program should take the entire link and store it as the Facebook field of the user.

4. If the user enters in the Facebook field a String that is not a link, the programe should **assume** that what was
entered was instead the **profile name** or **profile number** of the contact, and thus append the Facebook link prefix to it. +
For example, if user enters f/john for a contact, john's Facebook field would be "https://facebook.com/john/".

To perform steps 3 and 4, the program checks if that is entered in the field is a valid URL. If it is, then assume
it is 3. and store the entire URL as the Facebook field. Else, append and store that String as the Facebook field, which is 4.

In future update, will allow select command to open the facebook field instead of google searching the contact's name.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Empty or non-valid URL Facebook fields +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Turn it into a proper URL by appending the correct prefixes. +
**Pros:** More readable on the Person Card, user can easily see if there is a mistake. +
**Cons:** May create some strange links. +
**Alternative 2:** Leave it as it is. +
**Pros:** Simple to implement. +
**Cons:** Will look strange and ambiguous on the Person Card, especially if user made a mistake and does not notice. +

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::tasks[]
=== Task class mechanism

The `Task` class, which is located inside `Model`, is implemented with similar logic as `Person` class. We have introduced three commands that modifies the address book: `addt`, `editt` and `deletet`, which extends `UndoableCommand`.
A `Task` consist of three sub-components: `Header`, `Desc` and `Deadline`. Commands such as `undo` and `redo` can be used to alter events in the list as they deal with code that directly modifies the address book.

The `TaskPanel` is incorporated into the address book `MainWindow` to display all the tasks inside the internal list using `ObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>`. This process will be explained later on under the section `Task card`.

==== Task methods
As mentioned earlier, the `Task` class contains three main methods: `addt`, `editt` and `deletet`.
The execution flow is similar for all three methods on a higher level.

==== Exceptions
When the user input a task command with its parameters, the validity of the command word is checked inside the `AddressBookParser`. Next, the presence of the parameter prefixes is checked inside `AddTaskCommandParser`.
An appropriate `ParseException` will be thrown if the command word or prefixes are incorrect.

Before modifying the list of tasks inside the address book, the system may throw exceptions due to some invalid parameters. Here are the possible exceptions:

* `TaskNotFoundException`: This exception can be thrown by `editt` and `deletet` command when the an invalid index for a task is provided by the user. The index needs to be within the size of the task list at the current state of the address book.
* `DuplicateTaskException`: This exception can be thrown by `addt` and `editt` command. The system will first create an `Task` object with the input parameters, compare the object to all tasks residing in the task list and throw this exception if there is a duplicate found.

Editing of task is implemented this way:

[source,java]
----
    ReadOnlyTask taskToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
    Task editedTask = createEditedTask(taskToEdit, editTaskDescriptor);

    try {
        model.updateTask(taskToEdit, editedTask);
    } catch (DuplicateTaskException dee) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_TASK);
    } catch (TaskNotFoundException enfe) {
        throw new AssertionError("The target task cannot be missing");
    }
    model.updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS);
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_EDIT_TASK_SUCCESS, editedTask));
----

==== Task card
The `TaskCard` class extends `UiPart<Region>` to represent a distinct part of the UI. The object properties of every task is assigned to a label held by an `TaskCard`. The graphic scene is then constructed with the appropriate `FXML` files created to support the display of all tasks.

===== Design implementation
When the user starts the `MainApp`, the system calls the `UiManager` to create a new `MainWindow` and fills it with `TaskListPanel` and other components. The displayed events are created by `UniqueTaskList` and the binding of individual UI elements to the `TaskCard` ensures that any changes to the parameter will be displayed in the `TaskListPanel`.
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between the `TaskCard` and the `UiManager`:

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect(future enhancement):** How to implement adding/tagging of contacts into a `Task` using a `Person` list parameter +

**Chosen Implementation:** +
Add by the index of contact shown in the `PersonListPanel`. +
**Pros:** +
The system only has to check for validity of index which leads to increased performance. +
**Cons:** +
This requires the user to refer to the `PersonListPanel` before executing command to add contact into task's `Person` list. +

**Alternative:** Add by the name of contact in the `Person` list. +
**Pros:** +
Easier for users to add using names, as they do not need to refer to the `Person` list. +
**Cons:** +
System has to check through the list to check if the contact's name exist in the current address book, which can be more difficult if there are more than one contacts with the same name.
// end::tasks[]

// tag::gmail[]
=== Send email mechanism

The send email mechanism is facilitated by a specific Google account, which the user needs to login to before he can begin using the application to send e-mails.
He can then use the command-line interface of the application to add the recipient, subject and body of the e-mail.

E-mails can be sent to the e-mail address attached to any contact in the address book.

Sending of e-mails is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException, GoogleAuthException {
    requireNonNull(model);
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

    if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
    }

    String personToSendEmail = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()).getEmail().toString();

    try {
        MimeMessage emailToBeSent = ModelManager.createEmail(personToSendEmail,
                EMAIL_SENDER, emailSubject, emailBody);
        Gmail gmailService = new GetGmailService().getGmailService();
        message = ModelManager.sendMessage(gmailService, EMAIL_SENDER, emailToBeSent);
    } catch (MessagingException | IOException E) {
        assert false;
    }

    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS));
}
----

[NOTE]
Users must login using your e-mail and password to a specific Google account before they can start using this feature.
If login is unsuccessful, they will be prompted to login again.

[NOTE]
Requested access by Google must be provided before any e-mails can be sent.

[NOTE]
Internet connectivity is needed for this feature as the application does not store any e-mail drafts.

[NOTE]
Send e-mail feature must be used immediately after login as the application does not store any user data. Hence after login is
successful, it is not possible to use other commands and then use the send e-mail command.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of send e-mail +
**Alternative 1:** Save login details to allow more flexibilty.` +
**Pros:** Easier access to command as users can execute other commands in between login and sending e-mails. +
**Cons:** Security concerns raised as user data is saved within the application. +
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Only allow users to use send command immediately after login.` +
**Pros:** Safe option as no user details are stored even when the command is used repeatedly. +
**Cons:** Not user-friendly as it forces users to use features of the application in a certain order.
// end::gmail[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.

****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class

We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
