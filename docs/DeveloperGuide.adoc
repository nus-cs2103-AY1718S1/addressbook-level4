== Introduction

iContacts is an address book application whose target audience is university students. iContacts aim to help
students manage their contacts effectively and efficiently, as well as providing many other features
such as setting reminders, tagging of contacts, emailing and more.
This guide provides information for those who wish to join our team as either a developer or tester,
and is intended to help you quickly understand the internal design of the application so that you will be able to
understand how this application work. The guide also explains in detail the implementation of noteworthy features,
as well as the testing methods used in developing iContacts.

== Setting up

This section will guide you on how to set up the development environment for coding.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has link:#gradle[Gradle] and link:#javafx[JavaFx] plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

The following configurations need to be done before a developer starts writing the code. This is done to ensure that
the java coding styles and practices are followed.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. Here are the steps to rectify the order:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order:

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up link:#travis[Travis] to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up link:#appveyor[AppVeyor] as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section below:

== Design

This section will explain the design aspects of iContacts.

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above (Refer to Figure 1) explains the high-level design of iContacts.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Below is a quick overview of each component:

* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`], and it does the following:

** At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
** At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

* link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

** `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by the components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
** `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to iContacts' log file.

* The rest of iContacts consists of four components:

** link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : This is the UI of iContacts.
** link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : This is the command executor.
** link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : This holds the data of the App in-memory.
** link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : This reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

*** defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
*** exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (Refer to Figure 2) defines its _API_ in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2 : Class Diagram of the Logic component_


=== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below (Refer to Figure 3) shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (Part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises an `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the address book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below (Refer to Figure 4) shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (Part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without the `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this _Event-Driven_ approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

=== Components

This section explains the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` component used in iContacts.

==== UI component

The `UI` component provides  the _API_ of Graphical User Interface. The figure below (Refer to Figure 5) shows the structure of the `UI` component.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5 : Structure of the UI component_

*_API_* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All of these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these `UI` parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component

* executes the user commands using the `Logic` component.
* binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the `UI` can auto-update when the data in the `Model` changes.
* responds to events raised from various parts of iContacts and updates the `UI` accordingly.

==== Logic component
The `Logic` component deals with how each command and its parser would be executed in an event-driven design. The figures below (Refer to Figures 6, 7) shows the structure of the `Logic` component.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 6 : Structure of the Logic component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 7 : Structure of Commands in the Logic component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 6_

*_API_* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The `Logic` component uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

The figure below (Refer to Figure 8) shows the sequence diagram of interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` _API_ call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 8 : Interactions inside the Logic component for the `delete 1` command_

==== Model component
The `Model` component handles the contacts in the address book and all its stored details in data structures which provide _APIs_ to create, read, update and delete the contacts. The figure below (Refer to Figure 9) shows the structure of the `Model` component.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 9 : Structure of the Model component_

*_API_* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the `UI` can be bound to this list so that the `UI` automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (`UI`, `Logic` and `Storage`).

==== Storage component
The `Storage` component handles the storage of all data of the address book in the local device. The figure below (Refer to Figure 10) shows the structure of the Storage component.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 10 : Structure of the Storage component_

*_API_* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the reminder data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented, as well as design considerations for some features.

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter mechanism

The `FilterCommand` uses the `NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` to filter the persons with matching name and/or tags. It accepts the `List<String> nameKeywords` and `List<String> tagKeywords` as parameters that are parsed by the `FilterCommandParser`. The code snippet below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    public NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String> nameKeywords, List<String> tagKeywords) {
        this.nameKeywords = nameKeywords;
        this.tagKeywords = tagKeywords;
    }
}
----

The method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)` iterates through the `nameKeywords` and the `tagKeywords` to find a match of every `person` from the address book.

Below is an extract of the method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)`. The method `countTagMatches(person)` counts and returns the number of matches between the tags of the `person` and the tags in the `tagKeywords`. If the `tagsMatchedCount` is equal to the size of the `tagKeywords`, this means all the keywords in the `tagKeywords` match. The `hasTag` will then be set to `true`.

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        boolean hasTag = false;

        int numTagKeywords = tagKeywords.size();
        int tagsMatchedCount = 0;
        if (!tagKeywords.isEmpty()) {
            tagsMatchedCount = countTagMatches(person);
        }

        if (tagsMatchedCount == numTagKeywords) {
            hasTag = true;
        }
}
----

Below is an extract of the same method for name. Each keywords in the `nameKeywords` will be compared against the name list retrieved from the `getName()` method of the `Person` class. If all the keywords match, the `hasName` will be set to `true`.

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        boolean hasName = false;
            if (!nameKeywords.isEmpty()) {
                hasName = nameKeywords.stream().allMatch(nameKeywords -> StringUtil
                .containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, nameKeywords));
        }
    }
}
----

For the `FilterCommand` to work properly, either the `nameKeywords` or the `tagKeywords` must be non-empty.

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Should similar search commands be separated +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command to search for contacts that match all keywords. +
**Pros:** Users will not be confused between the functionality of the `find` and `filter` commands. +
**Cons:** Users have to remember an additional command. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify the `FindCommand` to allow users the option to search contacts that either match any keywords or match all keywords. +
**Pros:** Lesser command for the users to remember when searching for contacts. +
**Cons:** Implementation can be more complicated as there is a need to address both `OR` search and `AND` search on the same command.
// end::filter[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export mechanism

The `ExportCommand` uses `XmlAddressBookStorage` class to generate a xml file based on a given range and saves it to the path provided. It takes in two `String` values `range` and `path`. Below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {
    public ExportCommand(String range, String path) {
        requireNonNull(range);
        requireNonNull(path);

        this.range = range;
        this.path = path;
        exportBook = new AddressBook();
    }
}
----

The method `getRangefromInput()` splits the range using a separator and returns a `String` array for the different values in the range.

Below is an extract of the method `getRangefromInput()`:

[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {
    private String[] getRangeFromInput() {
        private String[] getRangeFromInput() {
            String[] splitStringComma = this.range.split(",");

            return splitStringComma;
        }
    }
}
----

To determine which contacts should be added to the `exportBook` we have to check the the user input. There are three cases:

* All (Priority)
** if the word `all` is present in the user input, we will just export all the contacts from the last shown list.
* Specific index (e.g. 1, 2, 3)
** if the user input contains a specific index, we will add that index (one-based) to the `exportBook`.
* Range of indexes (e.g. 1-5,8-10)
** if the user input contains a range which is identified by the `-` character, we will add that range of index (one-based) to the `exportBook`.

Below is the code snippet to identify the three cases in the user input:

[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        String[] multipleRange = getRangeFromInput();

        if (multipleRange[0].equals("all")) {
            exportAll();
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < multipleRange.length; i++) {
                if (multipleRange[i].contains("-")) {
                    String[] rangeToExport = multipleRange[i].split("-");
                    try {
                        exportRange(Integer.parseInt(rangeToExport[0]), Integer.parseInt(rangeToExport[1]));
                    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_EXPORT_FAIL);
                    }

                } else {
                    try {
                        exportSpecific(Integer.parseInt(multipleRange[i]));
                    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_EXPORT_FAIL);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        /... storage is resolved here ...
    }
}
----

The final step is to create the xml file from the `exportBook`.

Below is the code snippet to export the data into an xml file using `AddressBookStorage`.
[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

    /... the exporting is resolved here ...

        try {
            AddressBookStorage storage = new XmlAddressBookStorage(path + ".xml");
            storage.saveAddressBook(exportBook);
        } catch (IOException ioe) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_EXPORT_FAIL);
        }
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_EXPORT_SUCCESS);
    }
}
----
// end::export[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import mechanism

The `ImportCommand` uses `XmlAddressBookStorage` to generate a temporary `AddressBook` object from a given path. It takes in a `String` value `path`. The command then adds the contacts found in the temporary AddressBook object into the main address book object. Below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public class ImportCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    public ImportCommand(String path) {
        this.path = path;
        this.addressBookStorage = new XmlAddressBookStorage(path);
        numSuccess = 0;
        numDuplicates = 0;
    }
}
----

The `ImportCommand` first checks if an AddressBook object can be initialised from the specified path, and if it does it initialises a new `Person` object and adds it into the main `AddressBook` object through the `model`. Below is the code snippet:
[source,java]
----
public class ImportCommand extends UndoableCommand {

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        try {
            if (addressBookStorage.readAddressBook().isPresent()) {
                this.addressBook = new AddressBook(addressBookStorage.readAddressBook().get());
                for (ReadOnlyPerson person : this.addressBook.getPersonList()) {
                    Person personToAdd = new Person(person);
                    personToAdd.setPopularityCounter(new PopularityCounter());
                    personToAdd.setDisplayPicture(new DisplayPicture(""));
                    try {
                        model.clearSelection();
                        model.showDefaultPanel();
                        model.addPerson(personToAdd);
                        numSuccess++;
                    } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
                        numDuplicates++;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_FILE, path));
            }
        } catch (DataConversionException | IOException e) {
            throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_FILE, path));
        }

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, numSuccess, numDuplicates));
    }
}
----
[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Should `PopularityCounter` and `DisplayPicture` be set to the default value +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Both `PopularityCounter` and `DisplayPicture` should be set to the default value.  +
**Pros:** Does not affect the contact's `PopularityCounter` and allows the user to set their own preferred `DisplayPicture` of a contact.  +
**Cons:** Users will not be able to share `DisplayPicture. +
**Alternative 2:** Import the contacts with both `PopularityCounter` and `DisplayPicture` unchanged. +
**Pros:** `DisplayPicture` will be imported into iContacts. +
**Cons:** The `PopularityCounter` of the user's contacts will be inaccurate.

// end::import[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism

The `FindCommand` uses `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` to find contacts with matching names or nicknames. It accepts `List<String> nameKeywords` as the parameter that is parsed by `FindCommandParser`. Below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public FindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate) {
        this.predicate = predicate;
    }
----

The method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)` iterates through `nameKeywords` to find a match with the name or nickname of every `person` from the address book.

Below is an extract of the method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person`.

[source,java]
----
   @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        return keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword))
                || keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getNickname().value, keyword));
    }
----

For the `FindCommand` to work properly `nameKeywords` must be non-empty. The code extract below checks for empty inputs:

[source,java]
----
    public FindCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        String trimmedArgs = args.trim();
        if (trimmedArgs.isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(
                    String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, FindCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        String[] nameKeywords = trimmedArgs.split("\\s+");

        return new FindCommand(new NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(nameKeywords)));
    }
----
// end::find[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting mechanism

The `SortCommand` uses a `SortedList` that is initialised with the current `filteredPerson` and is sorted using a comparator. Below is the code snippet:

[source,java]
----
sortedfilteredPersons = new SortedList<>(filteredPersons);

@Override
public void sortFilteredPersonList() {

    Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> sortByName = (o1, o2) -> o1.getName().fullName.compareTo(o2.getName().fullName);
    sortedfilteredPersons.setComparator(sortByName);
    indicateAddressBookChanged();
}
----
// end::sort[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modify the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram (Refer to Figure 11) shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 11 : Inheritance diagram for commands_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implement the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command) (Refer to Figure 12).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 12 : Stack diagram after executing Delete command_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person (Refer to Figure 13).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 13 : Stack diagram after executing Add command_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed (Refer to Figure 14).

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 14 : Stack diagram after executing Undo command_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram (Refer to Figure 15) shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 15 : Sequence diagram of the undo operation_

The redo operation does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow) (Refer to Figure 16).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 16 : Stack diagram after executing Clear command_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution (Refer to Figure 17):

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 17 : Stack diagram remains unchanged after executing List command_

The following activity diagram (Refer to Figure 18) summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`. +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Will be hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`. +
**Pros:** It will not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Will be easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** Care should be taken to ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Will make it easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** Won't require the need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** It will require dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]


// tag::displaypic[]
=== Display Picture mechanism

The `displaypic` command adds or updates the display picture for the contact specified. The image is then displayed as `ImageView` in `PersonCard` and `DetailsPanel`.
The arguments of the command are `INDEX` and `PATHOFIMAGE`. The image needs to be present in the local device of the user.

The Display Picture command is implemented in a way so that the image is read from the user specified path. It is then stored in iContacts directory so that the image is never lost.

By executing the given code below, a new folder named 'pictures/' is created if it is missing. The folder is used to store the images.

[source,java]
----

public void createPictureStorageFolder() throws IOException {
        requireNonNull(filePath);

        logger.info("Picture folder "  + filePath + " created if missing");
        File file  = new File(filePath);
        FileUtil.createIfMissing(file);
    }

----

Since the command has to read and write an image, the Storage architectural style is used and extended to Display pictures.

The following UML diagram shows the Storage Architecture for reading and writing of image file (Refer to Figure 19):

image::UMLStorageDisplaypic.PNG[width="300"]
_Figure 19 : UML Diagram for the extended Storage Component._


This command works by retrieving the image using `BufferedImage`. The command extracts the image from the specified absolute path of image e.g. `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\My files\pic.jpg`

It then stores the image in the folder called `/pictures/` present in the same directory as `.jar`  by giving it a unique hashcode based on the user's email address.
The reading and writing of images is done using the `ImageIO` class.


An event handler is used to notify the `UI` and `Storage` component of the changes made in image and its name.

The sequence diagram for adding a display picture is shown below (Refer to Figure 20): +

image::SDforDisplayPicture.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 20 : Sequence Diagram for Display Picture Command._


The binder for refreshing the image every time the picture is updated is implemented by the following function:


[source,java]
----
public class PersonCard extends UiPart<Region> {
    private void assignImage(ReadOnlyPerson person) {

        Image image = new Image("file:" + "pictures/" + person.getDisplayPicture().getPath() + ".png",
                            IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, false, false);

        displayPicture.setFill(new ImagePattern(image));
    }
}
----

The Display Picture mechanism is done by using `ImageView`/`ImagePattern` in JavaFX which is a part of the UI Component.
The `Circle` shape is used for better UI/UX design and is filled with the `ImagePattern`.
 The wireframe used to display the image for each person is shown below (Refer to Figure 21):

image::WireFramePersonCard.PNG[width="300"]
_Figure 21 : Wireframe for the `PersonCard`._


The new image stored in directory is given a unique name which is formed using the hash code of the unique email address of each contact.
The following code is used to set the name of image as the hash code:

[source,java]
----
public class DisplayPictureCommand extends Command {

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException, IOException {
        /... executes function of Reading and Writing Image ...

        displayPicture.setPath(readAndStoreImage.execute(displayPicture.getPath(),
                            personToEdit.getEmail().hashCode())); // image name formed in this line
    }
}
----

[discrete]
==== Reason for this type of implementation

The command is implemented in this manner because of the following:

* By specifying the index, there is no ambiguity as to who should be assigned the display picture.
* The `PATHOFIMAGE` must be an absolute path on the local device to make sure the image is referenced.
* The image is stored in directory with a unique name to avoid conflict. The hash code of the user's email address is used to maintain uniqueness.
* The task is done using CLI to follow project requirements.
* The image is stored in png format to ensure maximum compatibility.
* In case of image corruption/deletion, care is taken to avoid hanging of UI and display the default image. This is done by checking `file.exists()`.

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** At what stage should the image be read and stored +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make proper Storage Architecture for reading and writing of Image.   +
**Pros:** It will follow the existing Architectural Design and Software Engineering Principles like OCP.  +
**Cons:** It will take more time and will be tougher to implement. +
**Alternative 2:** Invoke 'ReadAndStoreImage' from Logic component. +
**Pros:** : It will be easier for new developers to understand the sequence diagram and maintains event-driven nature. +
**Cons:** It will cause bad architectural design and will not follow the pre-existing pattern and moreover will defy the Law of Demeter.

---

**Aspect:** How should the image be taken from user +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** User has to enter the absolute path of image by checking his local device.   +
**Pros:** It will be a complete CLI process.  +
**Cons:** It might be problematic for user to copy and paste and might result in error. +
**Alternative 2:** Pop up a `FileChooser` after the command is entered. +
**Pros:** It will be easier for users to mention the correct image quickly. +
**Cons:** It will no longer be a complete CLI process.

---

// end::displaypic[]

// tag::location[]

=== Location mechanism
The `location` command is implemented in the form of an event-driven mechanism .
The diagram below (Refer to Figure 22) shows the sequence diagram for the command execution:

image::locationSD.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 22 : Sequence diagram for the Location Command._

The execution of command raises an event `ShowLocationEvent`. This causes the `BrowserAndReminderPanel` to switch to Node `Browser` irrespective of the current state of the application.
The activity diagram for such case is shown below (Refer to Figure 23):

image::locationAD.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 23 : Sequence diagram for the Location Command._

The following code below ensures the set up for the GUI:

[source, java]
----
private void setUpToShowLocation() {
    if (currentlyInFront == Node.REMINDERS) {
        setUpToShowBrowser();
        browser.toFront();
        currentlyInFront = Node.BROWSER;
    }
}
----

The URL for denoting the specified person's address in Google Maps is set up through the following code:

[source, java]
----
public String loadPersonLocation(String address) {

        String[] splitAddressByWords = address.split("\\s");

        String keywordsOfUrl = "";

        for (String word: splitAddressByWords) {
            keywordsOfUrl += word;
            keywordsOfUrl += "+";
        }

        loadPage(GOOGLE_MAPS_URL + keywordsOfUrl);
}
----


[discrete]
==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** What to use to show the location +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show using google maps url in `BrowserPanel`.  +
**Pros:** We will be able to get the location easily and accurately. +
**Cons:** It could cause problem due to limited functionality of the URL. +
**Alternative 2:** Use Google Maps _API_. +
**Pros:**  It will provide more functionality. +
**Cons:** It could cause more resources to be used for the exact same feature and wouldn’t utilise pre-existing browser properly.

// end::location[]

// tag::email[]
=== Email mechanism

The `email` command has various fields to denote the Recipients (Tag), Subject, Body and Service.

The `email` command allows the users to compose an email in the default browser with data such as recipients, subject and body.

The relation between them is shown in the UML diagram below (Refer to Figure 24):

image::emailUML.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 24 : UML Class Diagram for the Email Feature._

The command is parsed to get the `Service`, `Tag`, `Subject` and `Body` fields.

The parsing takes place in the following manner (Refer to Figure 25):

image::ParserSDEmail.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 25 : Sequence diagram for parsing the Email Command._


[NOTE]
The recipients are all contacts belonging to a particular tag.
The only two services offered are `gmail` and `outlook` as our target users are students.

The email command happens through an event driven mechanism. The below diagram (Refer to Figure 26) shows sequence diagram for it.
The execution of command raises an event `SendingEmailEvent`.

image::emailSD.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 26 : Sequence diagram for the Email Command._



The URL for composing the mail is set up through the following code:

[source, java]
----
public static final String GMAIL_EMAIL_URL =
            "https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&source=mailto&to=%1$s&su=%2$s&body=%3$s";

public static final String OUTLOOK_EMAIL_URL =
            "https://outlook.office.com/?path=/mail/action/compose&to=%1$s&subject=%2$s&body=%3$s";

Desktop.getDesktop().browse(new URI(String.format(GMAIL_EMAIL_URL, recipients, subject, body)));
----

[discrete]
==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Where to compose the mail +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Opens the default browser of Desktop.  +
**Pros:** The default browser will have the user logged in to his email account.  +
**Cons:** High dependency on third party apps. +
**Alternative 2:** Open in `BrowserPanel`. +
**Pros:** No dependency on other apps. +
**Cons:** It will not auto fill in the text due to older version of browser.

// end::email[]

// tag::fvc[]
=== Frequently Visited Contacts mechanism

This feature brings in a new UI element  called `PopularContactList`, which is a list of maximum size of 5  and each element of showing the name, popularity rank and display picture in a `PopularContactCard`.
The way these UI elements are added is shown in the following diagram (Refer to Figure 27) :

image::umlfvc.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 27 : Class Diagram of UI with Popular Contact Panel._

The mechanism to show the top five most frequently visited contacts is facilitated by the `PopularityCounter` of each contact.
For every new person added into the address book, he is assigned a popularity counter of `0`. The top five popular contacts are extracted by sorting the list based on the field `PopularityCounter` of each person. In the case of two or more people having the same popularity counter, the person who was added earlier into iContacts is given higher priority.


[NOTE]
This feature is not implemented as a command.The list gets refreshed whenever the `PopularityCounter` is supposed to change.

The Frequently Visited Contacts mechanism is an event-driven mechanism. However, there is no explicit command to view the top five frequently visited contacts as they are always refreshed whenever there is an change in the address book. They are always displayed on the UI below the `CommandResult` panel.
The event to refresh the `PopularContactList`, `PopularContactChangedEvent` is triggered whenever any of the command that increases `PopularityCounter` is executed.

The event triggers the following method:

[source, java]
----
public void updatePopularContactList() {
        refreshWithPopulatingAddressBook();
        listOfPersonsForPopularContacts.sort((o1, o2) ->
                o2.getPopularityCounter().getCounter() - o1.getPopularityCounter().getCounter());

        getOnlyTopFiveMaximum();
    }
----

The following are the commands which will increase the `PopularityCounter` by one for the contacts viewed or searched:

*** `viewtag`
*** `select`
*** `details` [special case when counter increases by 2 as it is a stronger indicator of who could be a frequently visited contact]
*** `location`
*** `email`

On execution of any of the following command, an extra event is raised which updates the `PopularContactList` after updating the popularity counter of the contact.
The sequence diagram for the extra event is shown below for `select` command (Refer to Figure 28):

image::selectFreuentlyVisited.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 28 : Sequence diagram for frequently visited mechanism for `select` command._


[NOTE]
Manual selection of person through a click also increases the popularity counter of that person. This is the same action as the `details` command.


The following method is used to increase the `PopularityCounter` by one:

[source, java]
----
public ReadOnlyPerson increaseCounterByOne(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        person.getPopularityCounter().increasePopularityCounter();

        return new Person(person.getName(), person.getPhone(), person.getEmail(), person.getAddress(),
                person.getBirthday(), person.getNickname(), person.getDisplayPicture(), person.getPopularityCounter(),
                person.getTags());
    }
----


The sequence diagram below shows how the event is triggered and how the saving of updated address book takes place (Refer to Figure 29):


image::frequentlyVisitedSD.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 29 : Sequence diagram for frequently visited mechanism._

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to implement the feature +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Refresh the list every time one of the command that changes the `Popularity` is executed   +
**Pros:** Becomes a dynamic feature such that user can see favourite contacts at any time +
**Cons:** Makes application slightly slower as more execution of code for those commands +
**Alternative 2:** Execute command to refresh list of popular contacts +
**Pros:** Reduces regular refresh of list +
**Cons:** Will have to keep track of command history to see the list of commands executed before previous execution of favourites command
// end::fvc[]

// tag::details[]
=== Details Panel Implementation

The `details` command shows more details of the contact like address, birthday, email in addition to the details shown in the `PersonCard` of `PersonListPanel`

The `DetailsPanel` is an Anchor Pane which is embedded inside `BrowserAndReminderPanel`.

[NOTE]
At any point of time, only one of the three panels (Browser, Reminder, Details) inside `BrowserAndReminderPanel` will have the visibility set as `true` and in front of the other two panels.

The UML diagram below represents the UI structure for the `BrowserAndReminderPanel` (Refer to Figure 30):

image::umlDetails.png[width="790"]
_Figure 30 : UML Diagram for Panel._

The code to ensure only `DetailsPanel` is displayed on execution of command is shown below:

[source, java]
----
private void setUpToShowDetailsPanel() {
        detailsPanel.setVisible(true);
        remindersPanel.setVisible(false);
        browser.setVisible(false);
}
----


The `DetailsPanel` is also displayed when the user manually clicks on the `PersonCard`. This is made possible by raising the `SelectionChangedEvent` to show the `DetailsPanel`.
The `selectionModel()` of `PersonListView` is now linked to the `details` command rather than the `select` command.

[NOTE]
The `select` command now only scrolls to the INDEX specified whereas `details` command scrolls to and selects the person to show his/her details in the panel.

The figure below (Refer to figure 31) is the wireframe for the `DetailsPanel`:

image::wireframeDetailsPanel.PNG[width="600"]
_Figure 31 : Wireframe for Details Panel._

Using the `FontAwesomeFx` library, an icon is set for each label to make the UI look appealing as seen in the UI above (Refer to figure TBD).

The solution to show the same colour for a tag in `DetailsPanel` and `PersonCard` was resolved by having a *Singleton Class* `TagColor`.

The following code inside the class ensured that the class acts as an global class and since only one instance is created, it made the tag color's constant.


[source, java]
----
public static TagColor getInstance() {
        if (tagColor == null) {
            tagColor = new TagColor();
        }
        return tagColor;
    }
----

[discrete]
==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** How to improve UI +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show the extra details of contact after they are selected. +
**Pros**: Allows more contacts to be shown in the list as the information is reduced. +
**Cons**: User needs to manually select the user to see more details of that person. +
**Alternative 2:** Show all detail of person in the `PersonCard`. +
**Pros**: Reduces effort of selection of contact to see extra details. +
**Cons**: Looks very cluttered and has poor User Interface design.


//end::details[]

// tag::viewtag[]
=== View tag mechanism

The command is added into the `Logic` component according to following class diagram (Refer to Figure 32):

image::umlLogic.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 32 : Class Diagram of Logic._

The `viewtag` command works by setting the predicate to the `Observable filteredlist`.

Only one keyword is allowed for the command and it shows all people with the given tag.

The method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)` iterates through the `tagKeywords` to find a match of every `person` from the address book.

Streams and lambda (Java 8 features) are used to make the code more readable as shown below:

[source, java]
----
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        Set<Tag> tagsOfPerson = person.getTags();

        return tagsOfPerson.stream()
                .anyMatch(tagMatches -> tagMatches.getTagName().equalsIgnoreCase(keyword));

    }
----


[discrete]
==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** How to filter the list +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use of Lambda and Stream.  +
**Pros:**  The code is more readable. +
**Cons:** It sometimes takes more time to process than normal loops. +
**Alternative 2:** Loops and Conditions. +
**Pros:**  It is known to be faster than Streams at times. +
**Cons:** It is harder to avoid arrow-headed violation of coding style.

// end::viewtag[]


// tag::toggle[]
=== Toggling mechanism
The toggling mechanism is an `event-driven` mechanism.

image::togglingMechanism1.png[width="790]
_Figure 33 : Component interactions for the toggling mechanism._

The above diagram (Refer to Figure 33) shows the high-level overview of the component interactions for the toggling mechanism. +

image::togglingMechanism2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 34 : Sequence diagram for the first part of the toggling mechanism._

As seen from the sequence diagram above (Refer to Figure 34), when the user types the command for `toggle`, an instance of `ToggleCommand` would be created. +
Upon execution by `LogicManager`, the event `BrowserAndRemindersPanelToggleEvent` would be posted by the `EventCenter` to the `EventBus`:

[source, java]
----
public class ToggleCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new BrowserAndRemindersPanelToggleEvent());
        // ... return some object or null ...
    }
}
----


As seen from the diagram below (Refer to Figure 35), the method `handleBrowserToggleEvent()` in the `BrowserAndRemindersPanel` class in the `UI` component will then listen for the event,
and upon receiving the event it will invoke the method `toggleBrowserPanel` to trigger the actual toggling.

image::togglingMechanism3.png[width="790"]
_Figure 35 : Sequence diagram for the second part of the toggling mechanism._

The `BrowserAndRemindersPanel` class has a variable `currentlyInFront` keeping track of which panel (browser or reminders) is currently being shown.
`toggleBrowserPanel` would then use the `currentlyInFront` variable to toggle to and show the correct panel, and then update `currentlyInFront` appropriately:

[source, java]
----
public class BrowserAndRemindersPanel extends UIPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleBrowserPanelToggleEvent(BrowserAndRemindersPanelToggleEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        toggleBrowserPanel();
    }

    private void toggleBrowserPanel() {
        switch(currentlyInFront) {
        case BROWSER:
            setUpToShowRemindersPanel();
            remindersPanel.toFront();
            currentlyInFront = Node.REMINDERS;
            break;
        case REMINDERS:
            setUpToShowWebBrowser();
            browser.toFront();
            currentlyInFront = Node.BROWSER;
            break;


        //... Other cases ...

        }
    }
}
----

One important thing to note is that when the `select` command is executed, the browser panel would be brought forward no matter what:

[source, java]
----
public class BrowserAndRemindersPanel extends UIPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleLoadPersonPageEvent(LoadPersonWebpageEvent event) {
        setUpToShowWebBrowser();
        currentlyInFront = Node.BROWSER;
        browser.toFront();
        loadPersonPage(event.getPerson());
    }

    private void setUpToShowWebBrowser() {
        browser.setVisible(true);
        detailsPanel.setVisible(false);
        remindersPanel.setVisible(false);
     }
}
----

The `LoadPersonWebpageEvent` is posted whenever the `select` command is executed. Within the `handleLoadPersonPageEvent`
method, the statement `browser.toFront()` and the method `setUpToShowWebBrowser` would then bring the browser panel to the front no matter what, and also make it visible.

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Usage of browser area +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow users to toggle between the browser and reminders panel. +
**Pros**: Can use the entire space for either the browser or reminders panel. +
**Cons**: Users need to manually switch between the browser and reminders panel. +
**Alternative 2:** Put reminders and browser panels side-by-side. +
**Pros**: Users do not need to manually switch between the browser and reminders panel. +
**Cons**: Too little space for browser and reminders, making it difficult to read for the users.

**Aspect:** Implementation of toggling mechanism. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Bring browser and reminders panel to the front as required, on top of setting their visibility suitably. +
**Pros**: Users can interact with both browser and reminders (can scroll through reminders etc). +
**Cons**: More difficult to implement. +
**Alternative 2:** Only set visibility of browser and reminders panel as required (set browser visibility to false to display reminders and vice versa). +
**Pros**: Easier to implement. +
**Cons**: Users cannot interact with the reminders panel (since the browser is technically still at the front).
// end::toggle[]

//tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder Implementation
image::ReminderUML1.png[width="390"]
_Figure 36: UML class diagram showing the make-up of Reminder objects._

The `Reminder` object represents a reminder in iContacts. It contains a `String` variable `reminder`, which represents
the actual reminder from the user, and also a `Date`, `Time` and `Status` object, which represents the date, time and link:#status[status] of the reminder respectively
(Refer to Figure 36). As part of _defensive programming_, `Reminder` implements the `ReadOnlyReminder` interface, which only allows _read_ operations, thus
helping to prevent inappropriate or unintended modifications to `Reminder` objects (Refer to Figure 36) during the execution of the program.
For example, for `DeleteReminderCommand`, its `execute` method should only execute the deletion of a specified reminder, not to alter any reminders.
To ensure that no unintended or inappropriate alteration happens, `DeleteReminderCommand` is passed a list of `ReadOnlyReminder` instead of `Reminder`. This can
be seen from the code snippet below:

[source, java]
----
public class DeleteReminderCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        List<ReadOnlyReminder> reminderListing = model.getSortedReminderList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= reminderListing.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_REMINDER_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyReminder reminderToDelete = reminderListing.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

        try {
            model.deleteReminder(reminderToDelete);
        } catch (ReminderNotFoundException rnfe) {
            assert false : "The target reminder cannot be missing";
        }

        ... //return from method ...
    }

_Figure 37: In-memory implementation of Reminder._

In terms of how `Reminder` objects are kept in-memory during the execution of the program, `Reminder` objects are
kept within `UniqueReminderList` (Refer to Figure 37), which assures that there are no duplicate `Reminder` objects. The `UniqueReminderList`
object is then kept and used by `ModelManager` to carry out commands related to reminders while the program is running. +

Similar to `Reminder`, as can be seen from Figure 37 above, `UniqueReminderList` implements the `ReadOnlyUniqueReminderList` interface to prevent
inappropriate or unintended modifications to `UniqueReminderList` during the execution of the program. +

image::ReminderUML3.png[width="790"]
_Figure 38: How Reminder is stored._

As seen from Figure 38, `Reminder` objects are stored in a XML storage file in a JAXB-friendly version `XmlAdaptedReminder`. Notably, the `Status` object is not stored along with
the `Reminder` object; it is instantiated and initialized with an appropriate value during runtime when the `Reminder` object is instantiated.
When the program starts, `XmlAdaptedReminder` objects are read in as `XmlSerializableReminders` via `XmlFileStorage` and `XmlUtil`.
This can be seen below:

[source, java]
----
public class XmlFileStorage {

    public static XmlSerializableReminders loadRemindersFromSaveFile(File file) throws DataConversionException, FileNotFoundException {
        try{
            return XmlUtil.getDataFromFile(file, XmlSerializableReminders.class);
        } catch (JAXBException e) {
            throw new DataConversionException(e);
        }
    )

}
----

The `XmlSerializableReminders` object is then passed to `UniqueReminderList`, which then converts it into a list of `Reminder` objects for in-memory use.
This can be seen below:

[source, java]
----
public class UniqueReminderList implements Iterable<Reminder>, ReadOnlyUniqueReminderList {
    public UniqueReminderList(ReadOnlyUniqueReminderList xmlReminders) {
        requireNonNull(xmlReminders);
        try {
            setReminders(xmlReminders.toModelType());
        } catch (DuplicateReminderException dre) {
            assert false : "Reminders from storage should not have duplicates";
        }
    }

    public void setReminders(List<ReadOnlyReminder> reminders) throws DuplicateReminderException {
        final UniqueReminderList replacement = new UniqueReminderList();
        for (final ReadOnlyReminder reminder : reminders) {
            replacement.add(new Reminder(reminder));
        }
        setReminders(replacement);
    }

    public void setReminders(UniqueReminderList replacement) {
        this.internalList.setAll(replacement.internalList);
    }
}
----

As can be seen from the code snippet above and in Figure 38, as part of _defensive programming_, `XmlSerializableReminders` also implements the `ReadOnlyUniqueReminderList` interface. +

To save, the `saveReminders` method in `StorageManager` is invoked:

[source, java]
----

    @Override
    public void saveReminders(ReadOnlyUniqueReminderList reminderList) throws IOException {
        saveReminders(reminderList, remindersStorage.getRemindersFilePath());
    }

    @Override
    public void saveReminders(ReadOnlyUniqueReminderList reminderList, String filePath) throws IOException {
        logger.fine("Attempting to write to data file: " + filePath);
        remindersStorage.saveReminders(reminderList, filePath);
    }

----

This will then invoke the `saveReminders` method in `XmlRemindersStorage`, and go on to invoke the `saveRemindersToFile` method in `XmlFileStorage`,
and finally the `saveDataToFile` method in `XmlUtil`.

The color of the reminder cells are decided and set during the formation of `ReminderListViewCell`. This can be seen from the
code snippet below: +

[source, java]
----

public class BirthdayAndReminderListPanel extends UiPart<Region> {

    class ReminderListViewCell extends ListCell<ReminderCard> {

        @Override
        protected void updateItem(ReminderCard reminder, boolean empty) {
            super.updateItem(reminder, empty);

            if (empty || reminder == null) {
                setGraphic(null);
                setText(null);
                return;
            }
            this.getStylesheets().clear();
            if (reminder.isEventToday()) {
                this.getStylesheets().add(REMINDER_TODAY_STYLE_SHEET);
            } else if (reminder.isEventWithinThreeDays()) {
                this.getStylesheets().add(REMINDER_THREE_DAYS_STYLE_SHEET);
            } else if (!reminder.hasEventPassed()) {
                this.getStylesheets().add(REMINDER_NORMAL_STYLE_SHEET);
            }

            setGraphic(reminder.getRoot());
        }
    }

}

----

Depending on the status of the reminder, different styles would be set for the specific `ReminderListViewCell`.

The methods `isEventToday`, `isEventWithinThreeDays` and `hasEventPassed` seen from the code snippet above originate from
the `Status` object of each `Reminder` object and propagated from `Status` to `Reminder` then finally to `ReminderCard`.

[discrete]
==== Design Consideration
**Aspect:** How to store `Reminder` in-memory +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store `Reminder` objects in `UniqueReminderList`, independent of `AddressBook`. +
**Pros**: Follows the _Single-Responsibility Principle_, because a reminder should not be an address book's responsibility. +
**Cons**: More changes have to be made to the existing code base, making it tougher to implement. +
**Alternative 2:** Store `Reminder` objects within `AddressBook`. +
**Pros**: Easier to implement as lesser changes have to be made to the existing code base. +
**Cons**: Violates the _Single-Responsibility Principle_.

**Aspect:** Should the undo/redo mechanism be applied to `Reminder` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Commands that affect `Reminder` objects are not undoable/redoable. +
**Pros**: Users would be more aware of any changes they made to a reminder, as they are forced to
use the `editreminder`, `addreminder` and `deletereminder` commands. +
**Cons**: It is less user-friendly. +
**Alternative 2:** Commands that affect `Reminder` objects are undoable/redoable. +
**Pros**: More user-friendly. +
**Cons**: Users might get careless with changing the information of a `Reminder` object. This might be detrimental
as the date and time fields of a `Reminder` are very important.

=== Theme-changing mechanism

image::themeChangingMechanism1.png[width="790"]
_Figure 39 : Component interactions for the theme-changing mechanism_

The theme-changing mechanism is an event-driven mechanism. The above diagram (Refer to Figure 39) shows the high-level overview of the component interactions for the theme-changing mechanism.

image::themeChangingMechanism2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 40 : Sequence diagram for the first part of the theme-changing mechanism_

As shown from the sequence diagram above (Refer to Figure 40), after the user entered the command `theme day`, a new object `ThemeCommand` will be created. The `LogicManager` will then execute `ThemeCommand`, and the event `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` will be posted by `EventsCenter`. The code snippet below shows the `execute()` method of `ThemeCommand`:

----
public class ThemeCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent(theme));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SET_THEME_SUCCESS, theme.getTheme()));
    }
}
----

image::themeChangingMechanism3.png[width="790"]
_Figure 41 : Sequence diagram for the second part of the theme-changing mechanism_

As shown from the sequence diagram above (Refer to Figure 41), the method `handleChangeThemeEvent()` in `MainWindow` will handle the event and change the theme of the address book through the method `changeTheme()` accordingly.

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `ThemeCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilize `ChangeEventRequestEvent` that allow `MainWindow` to handle the event to change the theme. +
**Pros:** `ThemeCommand` can be more efficient since it does not directly change the theme. +
**Cons:** New developers may find it difficult to understand the event-driven nature of the application. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow `ThemeCommand` to set the theme directly by allowing it access to `MainWindow`. +
**Pros:** Easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Violates the architectural style as `ThemeCommand` belongs to the `Logic` component that should not be able to access the `UI` component where `MainWindow` belongs to.
// end::theme[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration]).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

The list below shows all the available logging levels used:

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below (Refer to Figure 42).

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests:

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

*  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include
** _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
** _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
*  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include
**  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
**  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
**  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, iContacts depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

* Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size).
* Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red (Refer to Figures 43 and 44).

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors) (Refer to Figures 45 and 46).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Target Users

This application is targeted towards University students, aiming to meet their needs throughout their university life, and hopefully beyond. University students meet many people in the university, such as project group members, tutors, lecturers, friends and other connections. Nowadays it is important for students to build connections with other people, as connections may also help students for their future career after graduation. Since the students meet a lot of people, they may not be able to remember all the information about the people they met. Therefore, iContacts aims to help students to store and manage their contacts easily.

*  User Profile

**  University Students
**  Students who are part of many CCA clubs and committees
**  Students taking on the role of Teaching Assistant/Tutor
**  Students who are interning and have colleagues
**  Students who have close friends and family
