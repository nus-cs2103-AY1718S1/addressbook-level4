Welcome to *ABC*!

*ABC* is a desktop Business Contact Management application, which is primarily a CLI (Command Line Interface)
application, but also uses a GUI (graphical user interface). It provides a convenient way for users
to customize their contacts and keep track of appointments. This guide provides information that will
help both experienced contributors and first-time users contribute to *ABC*.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
This app is not compatible with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default. +
Do not disable them. If they are disabled, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in a local computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to the local computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if the welcome screen is not displayed, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file, select it and click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message.
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure that they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with this standard, except for its different import order. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance while writing code.

==== Updating documentation to match the fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If there are plans to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` should be replaced with the URL of the fork.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

Set up Travis to perform CI for the fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> for information on how to set it up.

Optionally, set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures that the App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

Before starting to code, it is advisable to get a sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_*(Figure 2.1.1) given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : Takes charge of the UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : Executes commands.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality via a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 2.1.2 for its class diagram) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality via the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_(Figure 2.1.3a) below shows how the components interact in a scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Sequence Diagram for `delete 1` command (part a)_

[NOTE]
`Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram(Figure 2.1.3b) below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Sequence Diagram for `delete 1` command (part b)_

[NOTE]
The event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As seen in _Figure 2.2.1_, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of different parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in their corresponding `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can be updated automatically when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

As seen in _Figure 2.3.1_,

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

_Figure 2.3.3_ below shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

As seen in _Figure2.4.1_, the `Model` component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bounded to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

As seen in _Figure 2.5.1_, the `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

==== Mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As can be seen from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::restoreandbackup[]
=== Backup / Restoring Backup

==== Mechanism

The backing up of ABC is done by `BackupCommand` and the restoring of data from a backup file is done by `RestoreBackupCommand`.
`BackupCommand` inherits from `Command` as it does not support the undoing and redoing of user actions, whereas `RestoreBackupCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.
These commands require access to `Storage` from `Logic` and the way to accomplish this is to post an event to `EventsCenter`. `Subscribers` in `StorageManager` will handle these events and respond correspondingly.
The following shows a sequence diagram of how the `BackupCommand` is carried out.

image::BackupCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
`RestoreBackupCommand` shares a similar sequence diagram in terms of logic.

The `BackupCommand` is executed when the commands `backup` or `b` is entered. The data that is in `model` or the active address book is first passed as a parameter to `BackupDataEvent`. The event will be handled by `StorageManager` and is saved into the default file path "data/addressbook-backup.xml".
The following is the implementation of `BackupCommand`:
[source, java]
----
public class BackupCommand extends Command {
    //... variables, constructor, other methods...

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        // reading data from model
        ReadOnlyAddressBook backupAddressBookData = model.getAddressBook();

        // posting event to backup data
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new BackupDataEvent(backupAddressBookData));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS));
    }
}
----

The `RestoreBackupCommand` is executed when the commands `restore` or `rb` is entered. `RestoreBackupDataEvent` is posted and `StorageManager` handles it.
The data from default file path "data/addressbook-backup.xml" will be retrieved and it will replace the active address book.
The following is the implementation of `RestoreBackupCommand`:
[source, java]
----
public class RestoreBackupCommand extends Command {
    //... variables, constructor, other methods...

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        //... other codes and checks...

        RestoreBackupDataEvent event = new RestoreBackupDataEvent();

        // posting event to help with restoring backup data
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(event);

        // overwriting the data in active address book
        ReadOnlyAddressBook backupAddressBookData = event.getAddressBookData();
        model.resetData(backupAddressBookData);
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS));

        //... other codes and checks...
    }
}
----

If the backup file does not exist in the default file path, an error message will be shown to the user.
This check is done before `RestoreBackupEvent` is posted. Once again, this requires `Logic` to access `Storage`.
Therefore, a `BackupFilePresentEvent` will be posted and the `Subscriber` in `StorageManager` would handle this event to check if the backup file exist.

[NOTE]
A backup of the data is automatically created when *ABC* is closed.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Accessing `Storage` from `Logic` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make use of `EventBus` to post events and have `StorageManager` handle the backing up or retrieval of data +
**Pros:** Follows the architecture closely without introducing dependencies between components. +
**Cons:** New `Event` classes have to be created every time a command requires access to data in the storage.  +
**Alternative 2:** Allow `Logic` to access `Storage` and its functions +
**Pros:** Easier implementation for current and future functions or commands related to `Storage`. +
**Cons:** Increases coupling between the components. +
// end::restoreandbackup[]

// tag::addremovetag[]
=== Adding/Removing a tag

==== Mechanism

Adding or removing a tag is facilitated by `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand`, which are subclasses of `UndoableCommand`. These commands work by changing the value of the `Tag` objects associated with the contact.

These commands take in an integer and a string as arguments. The command is first parsed in `AddressBookParser` to identify it as the appropriate command. It will then be parsed by `AddTagCommandParser` or `DeleteTagCommandParser`, to parse the index, which was the integer argument, and the `Tag`, which was represented by the string argument. Invalid indexes and tags will be handled by throwing an exception. This is how `AddTagCommandParser` is implemented:
[source, java]
----
public class AddTagCommandParser implements Parser<AddTagCommand> {
    public AddTagCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        try {
            // ... parse `Index` and `Tag` and pass it to `AddTagCommand` ...
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            // ... throw an exception ...
        }
    }
}
----

To update the `Tag` objects associated with a `Person`, the set of `Tag` objects of that `Person` is copied to a new set. The new data is then modified, then copied into a newly created `Person` instance. This is implemented as follows:
[source, java]
----
public class AddTagCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    // ... variables, constructor, other methods ...
    private final Tag newTag;

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... fetch personToEdit ...

        Set<Tag> oldTags = new HashSet<Tag>(personToEdit.getTags());
        // ... check if tag is duplicated ...
        Person editedPerson = new Person(personToEdit);
        oldTags.add(newTag);
        editedPerson.setTags(oldTags);

        // ... try to replace personToEdit with editedPerson ...
    }
}

----
The diagram below (Figure 3.3.1) shows how `AddTagCommand` works.

image::AddTagSequenceDiagram.png[]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Sequence Diagram for AddTag_

`RemoveTagCommand` works in a similar way. Note that `AddTagCommand` will throw an exception if the `Tag` already exists for the `Person` selected. `DeleteTagCommand` throws an exception if the `Tag` is not found on the `Person`.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Changing the `Tag` objects of the selected `Person` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy set of `Tag` objects to a newly created set. Modify the newly created set. Then create a copy of the selected `Person` instance and replace its set of `Tag` objects. +
**Pros:** Ensures that the original value will be unchanged, which is important in the event that updating the `Person` instance fails in a later stage. +
**Cons:** Additional memory required to create a new `Person` instance. +
**Alternative 2:** Just edit the `Tag` set directly +
**Pros:** No need to instantiate new `Person` instance. Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Problematic implementation and bad coding practice. Modifying the original values directly can cause problems if updating the `Person` instance fails in a later stage.
// end::addremovetag[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filtering mechanism in find

==== Mechanism
The list of persons displayed is filtered by a [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html[Predicate]]
when the method `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` from the `Model` interface is invoked.

The relevant methods in the Model interface are as follows:

[source,java]
----
public interface Model {

    ...

    /** Returns the predicate of the current filtered person list */
    Predicate<? super ReadOnlyPerson> getPersonListPredicate();

    /** Updates the filter of the filtered person list to filter by the given {@code predicate}.*/
    void updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> predicate);

}
----


When `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` is invoked, every `person` in the **AddressBook** is evaluated against the `predicate`. +
A `person` is added to the displayed list if `predicate.test(person)` is evaluated to be TRUE. +
All `person` instances that fulfill the conditions specified in `predicate` are filtered to be displayed.

==== Filtering on the existing list
Note that all `person` instances in the existing list satisfy a Predicate `currentPredicate`. +
Given a new Predicate `newPredicate`, filtering on the existing list is equivalent to selecting `person` instancesthat satisfy both `currentPredicate` and `newPredicate`. +
From Figure 3.2.1, it can also be viewed as the intersection of two lists of `person` objects, each satisfying one of the two predicates respectively.

image::venn_diagram.png[height = 200, width = 250]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Venn Diagram for Filtering_

===== Implementation
The actual implementation of filtering on the existing list involves three steps. +

.  Invoke `getPersonListPredicate()` provided in the Model interface to get the `currentPredicate`.
.  Use [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html#and-java.util.function.Predicate-[Predicate.and()]] to generated the logical AND of the two predicates.
.  Update the list using the predicate generated in step 2.

For more detail, refer to the sequence diagram(Figure 3.4.2) below.

image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
_Figure 3.4.2 : Sequence Diagram for Filter_

===== Design consideration
The design for filtering on the existing list applies the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle[Open/Close Principle]].

* By providing a new extension of `getPersonListPredicate()` in the `Model` interface, the new feature is enabled. +
* By making use of the logical AND of two predicates, the list can be filtered without modification of the fundamental filtering mechanism. +
// end::filter[]

// tag::sync[]
=== Synchronisation with Google Contacts

==== Mechanism
Authentication and synchronisation of data with a user's Google Contacts is done via the `sync` command, which is a subclass of `Command`. This command works in conjunction with the Google Client and People API.

Firstly, the command posts an `AuthorizationEvent` event to the EventCenter, which is then handled by a `OAuth` class, which is chiefly responsible for authorization and interaction with a user's Google Contacts. Hence, threading allows for the application to run in the background, while the user can perform other tasks. The user is redirected to login to Google via his default browser through the invoked `authorize` method. A callback is then done to create a `Credential` which is then used to instantiate a `PeopleService` instance. The `PeopleService` is then used to perform CRUD functions on the user's Google Contacts. The following diagram shows the entire sequence.

image::SyncCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Methods

===== SyncCommand
Below is the implementation of `SyncCommand`, where the `AuthorizationEvent` is sent upon execution, and the command notifies the user that synchronisation has been initiated.

[source,java]
----
public class SyncCommand extends Command {
    //...variables, constructor, other methods

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {

        try {
            List<ReadOnlyPerson> personList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
            AuthorizationEvent event = new AuthorizationEvent(personList);
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(event);
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_FAILURE);
        }

    }
}
----

===== AuthorizationEvent Handler
The `OAuth` class handles the AuthorizationEvent. It first runs the `authorize` method to obtain a Credential, and uses that to create a `PeopleService`. The `exportContacts` method is then invoked to export all contacts to the AddressBook to Google Contacts. Below is the code for the handler.

[source,java]
----
public class OAuth {
    // variables, constructor and other methods

    @Subscribe
    public static void handleAuthorizationEvent(AuthorizationEvent event) throws Throwable {

===== Authorize with Google servers
Below is the `authorize` method implemented in `OAuth`, which uses the `People API` to get an authorization token, used to create a `PeopleService` to retrieve Google Contacts information. A `clients_secret.json` file is used to provide the required Client ID and Secret for the Google API. A `Credential` is returned from this method, which is then used to create a `PeopleService`.

[source,java]
----
public class OAuth {
    // variables, constructor and other methods

    /** Authorizes the installed application to access user's protected data. */
    private static Credential authorize() throws Exception {
        // load client secrets
        GoogleClientSecrets clientSecrets = GoogleClientSecrets.load(JSON_FACTORY,
                new InputStreamReader(OAuth.class.getResourceAsStream("/client_secrets.json")));
        if (clientSecrets.getDetails().getClientId().startsWith("Enter")
                || clientSecrets.getDetails().getClientSecret().startsWith("Enter ")) {
            System.out.println(
                    "Enter Client ID and Secret from https://code.google.com/apis/console/?api=people "
                            + "into seedu/address/src/main/resources/client_secrets.json");
            System.exit(1);
        }

        // set up authorization code flow
        GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow flow = new GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.Builder(
                httpTransport, JSON_FACTORY, clientSecrets,
                Collections.singleton(PeopleServiceScopes.CONTACTS)).setDataStoreFactory(dataStoreFactory)
                .build();

        // authorize

        return new AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp(flow, new LocalServerReceiver()).authorize("user");
    }

}
----

===== Export contacts to Google Contacts
Lastly, AddressBook contacts are then exported to Google Contacts via the `exportContacts` method. A `ReadOnlyPersonList` is obtained from the current AddressBook, and iterated through to add their entries into the user's Google account via the `createContact` method provided by People API. The code is shown below.

[source,java]
----
public class OAuth {

    /**Uploads AddressBook contacts to Google Contacts
     * TODO: Prevent adding of duplicates
     */
    private static void exportContacts (List<ReadOnlyPerson> personList) throws IOException {
        for (ReadOnlyPerson person : personList) {
            Person contactToCreate = new Person();
            List<Name> name = new ArrayList<Name>();
            List<EmailAddress> email = new ArrayList<EmailAddress>();
            List<Address> address = new ArrayList<Address>();
            List<PhoneNumber> phone = new ArrayList<PhoneNumber>();
            name.add(new Name().setGivenName(person.getName().fullName));
            email.add(new EmailAddress().setValue(person.getEmail().value));
            address.add(new Address().setFormattedValue(person.getAddress().value));
            phone.add(new PhoneNumber().setValue(person.getPhone().value));

            contactToCreate.setNames(name)
                            .setEmailAddresses(email)
                            .setAddresses(address)
                            .setPhoneNumbers(phone);

            Person createdContact = client.people().createContact(contactToCreate).execute();
        }
    }

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Google Authorization +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** A thread is used +
**Pros:** Users can use the application and execute other commands asynchronously from the authorization +
**Cons:** It is thus more difficult to show the progress of the syncCommand

**Alternative 2:** Block the application while waiting for authorization +
**Pros:** Users will know the progress of the SyncCommand +
**Cons:** The application will freeze if authorization is done, or done in a manner not coded for by the People API (e.g. exiting the window via the 'X' or 'Close' button

---

**Aspect:** Accessing `OAuth` from `Logic` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** An `Event` and a `Subscriber` is used to communicate between the two different components +
**Pros:** Maintain low coupling and prevent unnecessary addition of dependencies +
**Cons:** Handlers have to be created to handle `Events` when they occur +

**Alternative 2:** Create an `OAuth` object in `Logic` +
**Pros:** No handlers are required to process `Events` +
**Cons:** Introduce unnecessary dependencies
// end::sync[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
