== Introduction

=== What is Rubrika?

Rubrika is a desktop Address Book application that lets you store and manage your contacts in a convenient manner. +
Rubrika has a simple link:#GUI[GUI] and allows you to interact using the link:#CLI[CLI].

This document will assist you in understanding the underlying mechanics of Rubrika and guide you through to making your first and subsequent contribution.

=== Need help?

We understand that first time contributors may face multiple problems. If you are having trouble following the documentation, please feel free to contact us at devproblem@rubrika.com directly, so we can assist you personally with any issues regarding Rubrika.

[[settingup]]
== Setting up

Before you start contributing to Rubrika, please take a look below and ensure that you have met the required specification.

=== Prerequisites

Firstly, please ensure that the following development tools are installed on your computer.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
If you are missing JDK, you may download it for free [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here]]

+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them. +
If you are missing IntelliJ, you may download the community version for free [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here]]


=== Setting up the project in your computer

Now that you have the required development tools on your computer, it's time to set up Rubrika.

. Fork this repository, and clone the fork on to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Before proceeding, please take a moment to verify your project files to ensure that you have completed the previous steps correctly.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

=== Getting started with coding

Congratulations! You are now ready to take your first step in contributing to Rubrika!

Before you proceed, we advise that you take a look at the following documents.

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

[[design]]
== Design

[[architecture]]
=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* link:#autocomplete-component[*`AutoCompleteLogic`*] : Completes user commands.

Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== AutoCompleteLogic component

image::AutoCompleteLogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6.1 : Structure of the AutoCompleteLogic Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/autocomplete/AutoCompleteLogic.java[`AutoCompleteLogic.java`]

The `AutoCompleteLogic` component,

* can take in incomplete user input and generate a list of possible autocomplete options.
* can store autocomplete options such that new lists need not be generated every time.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Class diagram of commands inside Logic component._

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2 : Visualisation of the `UndoRedoStack`, on executing `delete 5`._

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3 : Visualisation of the `UndoRedoStack`, on executing `add n/David ...`._

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4 : Visualisation of undoing the last command: `add n/David ...`._

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.5 : Sequence diagram showing the command calls involved in an undo operation._

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.6 : Visualisation of the `UndoRedoStack` when Redo stack is emptied on execution of a new Undoable command if the Redo stack is not empty._

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.7 : Nothing happens to the `UndoRedoStack` if the command execute is not undoable._

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.8 : Flow chart that explains the design of the `UndoRedoStack`._

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::autocomplete[]

=== Autocomplete

The autocomplete feature is activated by the autocomplete button `Tab`, and depending on the degree of completeness of user input, do one of the following:

* Spell out the incomplete command the user is trying to input, as well as generate command skeleton for the user to fill in the fields;
* Fill out the field denoted by the closest prefix for the user, based on the data present in the Model component; or
* Fill out the command argument based on the command word that is already present, the argument is sometimes filled based on data in the Model component.

The Autocomplete feature is made its own component since Autocomplete no longer just complete commands (as in version 1.1), but also depend on information in Logic and Model component.

The Autocomplete is built such that while in operation, the only input is the incomplete user input 'stub' as specified in `AutoCompleteLogic` interface, and the list of possible autocomplete options will be generated from the 'stub'.

The list of options is generated according to several defining characteristics of this 'stub', as follows:

* Number of words (each word is defined as one segment separated by whitespace) in the 'stub';
* Command word, if present, in the 'stub'; and
* Closest prefix to the end of the 'stub' if the command utilises prefixes.

An `AutoCompleteParser` will be chosen for the 'stub' based on the characteristics listed above, each of the specialize in fetching and matching different sets of data.

image::AutoCompleteLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Sequence diagram of `AutoCompleteLogic` in action._

Different implementations of `AutoCompleteParser` to parse different options shall be explained below.

==== `AutoCompleteCommandParser`

`AutoCompleteCommandParser` takes in an incomplete user command, match it with a list of command words currently supported in the application, and parses back the corresponding command skeleton for the user to fill in. The command skeleton is specified in each `Command` class in the `COMMAND_USAGE` constant.

Some commands that take in just a single argument (usually a numerical index), can simply autocomplete to the command word itself with a space behind:
[source,java]
----
public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
	public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "delete";
	public static final String COMMAND_USAGE = COMMAND_WORD + " ";
}
----

Others may be a bit more complicated, and require several arguments from the user. A more complex command skeleton may be required in this case:
[source,java]
----
public class AddCommand extends UndoableCommand {
	public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "add";
	public static final String COMMAND_USAGE = COMMAND_WORD + " "
            + PREFIX_NAME + "<NAME> "
            + PREFIX_PHONE + "<PHONE> "
            + PREFIX_EMAIL + "<EMAIL> "
            + PREFIX_ADDRESS + "<ADDRESS> "
            + PREFIX_TAG + "[TAG]...";
}
----

At the moment command skeletons are hardcoded and every command can only have one command skeleton, based on implementation in AutoCompleteCommandParser.java.

==== `AutoCompleteByPrefixModelParser`

`AutoCompleteByPrefixModelParser` (and its subclasses `AutoCompleteTagParser` and `AutoCompleteWordInNameParser`) draw existing data from the `Model` component, to match against incomplete user input.

`AutoCompleteByPrefixModelParser` requires there to be a prefix in order to be able to produce a list of possible options, and the prefix is usually the prefix closest to the caret.

The parser will proceed to extract only the relevant information from `Model` and match them against the input.

==== `AutoCompleteTagParser`

`AutoCompleteTagParser` is designed for `findtag` and `removetag` commands, and can parse tags from `Model` without the need for a tag to be present.

==== `AutoCompleteWordInNameParser`

`AutoCompleteWordInNameParser` is designed for `find` command, and in addition to retrieving every person's name from `Model`, the parser also split every name into keywords and flatten the resultant list.

This flattened list is then matched with the incomplete user input stub, such that only keywords are matched when a user attempts to use `find` command, instead of the whole name.

==== `AutoCompleteSetStringParser`

`AutoCompleteSetStringParser` is designed for `sort` and `theme` command, where the parser will only match user input stub against a fixed list of String, supplied at constructor.

==== `IdentityParser`

`IdentityParser` does not actually match anything, and is used to catch any invalid user input autocompletion attempts. The user input is returned as it is by this parser.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Command skeleton for each command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Support only one command skeleton for every command +
**Pros:** Easy to track and search for parsing in AutoCompleteCommandParser. +
**Cons:** Less flexibility and possible patterns for some commands. (e.g. `edit` command) +
**Alternative 2:** Able to support multiple command skeletons for every command +
**Pros:** Opens up possibility for some commands to produce different command skeletons based on user needs. +
**Cons:** Hard to keep track for parsing and extra overhead required to flatten the multiple command skeletons in each command class.

---

**Aspect:** Maintained support for command alias +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** No longer support command alias +
**Pros:** Only need one extra constant in each command, cleaner code in the long run to drop support for less useful or similar features. +
**Cons:** Changes will have to be made again to commands that were done or are still under development. +
**Alternative 2:** Continue to support command alias +
**Pros:** Easier to just add another constant on top of current `COMMAND_ALIAS` constant. +
**Cons:** Code gets messy in the long term if old features are not depreciated and removed, more constants to declare for every subsequent command added.

---

**Aspect:** Implement dropdown menu UI for autocomplete +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** No dropdown menu
**Pros:** No need for additional UI component. +
**Cons:** May not be intuitive to users who have not worked with CLI before.
**Alternative 2:** Include dropdown menu to list all autocomplete options +
**Pros:** Easier access for users at a glance. +
**Cons:** Inteferes with up and down button for command history.
// end::autocomplete[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::rmtag[]
=== RemoveTag Function

This section details the implementation of the Rubrika's `RemoveTag` feature.

The remove tag function is done by calling a `removetag` function which resides in the `ModelManager` class. Currently it supports removing the tag from every individual of the addressbook as well as removing a specific tag from a specified person shown on the list.

The following is the sequence diagram of how the RemoveTagCommands removes a tag from a specified person in the list after a person has entered a `removetag` command.

image::RemoveOneTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1 : Sequence Diagram of removeTag function_

If the user inputs `all` in the `INDEX` field, instead of removing a tag based on the list displayed in `Model`, the tag is removed from everyone in the `UniquePersonList` of `AddressBook`. The `TAG` is then deleted from the `UniqueTagList` in `AddressBook`. +

If the user inputs an `Integer` in the `INDEX` field, the tag is removed from the person as well as the `UniqueTagList` in the `AddressBook`. Thereafter, we re-sync the `Tag` Objects in `UniqueTagList` with all the `Tag` contained within the `Person` Object in the `UniquePersonList`. +

[NOTE]
If more than one tag is given or if `INDEX` out of the range of the shown list is given, `ParseException` will be thrown before execution of the function.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Which tags to remove when removing all tags. +

**Alternative 1 (current):** Remove all `TAG` s from the addressbook regardless of current view. +
**Pros:** Completely removes the specified `TAG` from the whole addressbook +
**Cons:** User may want to remove only from list shown instead of the whole list. +

**Alternative 2:** Remove all tags for the list shown to the user. +
**Pros:** User may removetag from only the list of people shown to them.
**Cons:** Required to sync the `UniqueTagList` of `AddressBook` as `TAGS` removed may still exist in the `AddresBook`.

---

**Aspect:** How to sync `tag` in `UniqueTagList` after deleting from one `Person`

**Alternative 1 (current):** Deletes `TAG` from `UniqueTagList`, then re-sync with `persons` list. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** If the `Tag` still exists in another contact, then it is a pointless deletion.

**Alternative 2:** Checks if 'Tag` deleted is contained in another `Person`. +
**Pros:** Not required to delete `Tag` from `UniqueTagList` if it still exist in any `Person`.
**Cons:** Uses more resources since Rubrika will need to check check through everyone before deleting from `UniqueTagList`.
// end::rmtag[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Function

This section details the implementation of the Rubrika's `Sort` feature.

Rubrika's sort function allows user to display their list of contacts in a specified order.

[NOTE]
The arrangement of contacts after sorting is *not meant to be permanent*. +
The sort function merely displays the list in a specified manner when the user requests to do so.

The sort function is done by calling the `sortFilteredPersonList` method which resides in the `ModelManager` class. `Sort` currently supports sorting by name, email and phone in ascending or descending order. +

Firstly, after the `FIELD` and `ORDER` of the sort command has been entered, the `sortCommandParser` fetches the appropriate `Comparator` from `ReadOnlyPerson`.

Below is a code fragment detailing the selection process.

----
public SortCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        ....
        String trimmedArgs = args.trim();

        switch (trimmedArgs) {
        case SORTBYNAMEASCENDING:
            return new SortCommand(ReadOnlyPerson.NAMESORTASC);
        case SORTBYEMAILASCENDING:
            return new SortCommand(ReadOnlyPerson.EMAILSORTASC);

For each way of sorting, a different comparator is being passed into `SortCommand`. +

The following is a sequence diagram detailing the process of how `sort` instruction is handled by Rubrika after the `SortCommandParser` has been created in `AddressBookParser`. It also shows how `UI` component is able to display the sorted list. +

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.1 : Sequence Diagram of sort function_

Within `Model` component, `FilteredList` is masked by a `SortedList` object.

When a user wants to sort his list of contacts in Rubrika, `execute` method in `SortCommand` call `sortFilteredPersonList` method within `Model`. This sets the comparator that been parsed by `SortCommandParser` into the `SortedList`.

Below is the code fragment found in `ModelManager` that changes the comparator used on the list of contacts.

----
    @Override
    public void sortFilteredPersonList(Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> comparator) {
        sortedPersons.setComparator(comparator);
    }
----

[NOTE]
If arguments given do not comply with the correct format, ParseException will be thrown before execution of the function. +
Sort Command is an undoable Command.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Whether to sort the intern list of the addressBook or just the filtered list. +

**Alternative 1 (current):** Sorts the filteredList found in `ModelManager`. +
**Pros:** A more defensive approach as `UniquePersonList` in `AddressBook` is not modified in anyway. +
**Pros:** User may have already have a preferred way of listing users and may only want to sort once for convenience. +
**Cons:** More difficult to implement, and requires the `SortedList` object. +
**Cons:** Other methods within `ModelManager` must be modified since `SortedList` is the list being displayed, not FilteredList. +

**Alternative 2:** Sorts the `UniquePersonList` found in `AddressBook`. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement since `UniquePersonList` is implemented using `List`. +
**Cons:** A sort will rearrange contacts permanently, and the previous arrangement will be lost permanently.+
// end::sort[]

// tag::importexport[]
=== Import function

This section details the implementation of the Rubrika's `Import` feature.

The `import` function supports importing of vCard files (.vcf) and XML files (.xml).

The diagram below details the sequence of how Rubrika handles the `import` command after the user has entered the command. Note that the diagram assumes the user has included the `FILEPATH` of the import file.

image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.1 : Sequence Diagram of import function_

In the case a file path is not specified, the `ImportCommandParser` raises a `ImportFileChooseEvent` which opens up a `FileChooser` window for the user to select his import `File`. The `File` is then passed back to the `ImportCommandParser` to extract the `Person` Objects.

To parse the `File` into a list of `Person`, ImportCommandParser calls a static method within XmlFileStorage or VcfImport depending on the file type to be imported. A more detailed sequence of event is shown below in Figure 4.7.2.

image::ImportSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.2 : Sequence Diagram Interaction between ImportCommandParser and XmlFileStorage and VcfImport_

Finally,The list of person is then added using the `addPerson` method found in `model`.

[NOTE]
The import function merges the contacts in the export files with the ones currently in the addressbook. If duplicate persons are found, Rubrika will inform the user of the number of duplicated contacts found. +
 +
Also, for importing of .vcf files, due to using an inbuilt parser, only vCards created by Rubrika will work.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Choice of parsing XML files. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice)** : Using the `loadDataFromSaveFile` static method found in `XmlFileStorage`. +
**Pros** : Able to call static method directly from `Logic` Component, hence easier to implement. +
**Cons** : Slightly more coupling issues as a change in either files might require a change in the other. +

**Alternative 2** : Using the `readAddressBook` method in `AddressBookStorage` class. +
**Pros** : Does not bypass `StorageManager` component and already handles `logging`. +
**Cons** : Even more coupling between the 3 classes. Also we will need to instantiate a `StorageManager` object within Logic. +

**Alternative 3** : Writing a built-in parser that parses the XML diagram directly into a `List` Object. +
**Pros** : Less coupling as the parser will only be associated with `ImportCommandParser`. +
**Cons** : Very intensive to implement within the given time frame.

=== Export Function

This section details the implementation of the Rubrika's `Export` feature.

The export function is done by the `ExportCommand` class, and currently supports exporting to vCard files (.vcf) and XML files (.xml).

[NOTE]
Currently, the export function only ensures that the vCard file created is supported by Rubrika application.

After input validation in the `ExportCommandParser` class, the file path is passed to the `ExportCommand` class.

[NOTE]
If the file format is not specified by the user during input, ParseException will be thrown before execution of the Command.

In the `ExportCommand` class, depending on the file type requested by the user, a different method will be used to create the export file.

The following Sequence Diagram will detail the events that occur after a user has entered a valid export Command for a XML file.

image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.8.1 : Sequence Diagram of export command._

If the file defined by the user uses a XML (.xml) file extension then the addressbook is exported into a XML file by using the static method `saveDataToFile` in the `XmlFileStorage` class.

If the file defined by the user uses a vCard (.vcf) file extension, then the addressbook is exported dinto a vCard file by using the static method `saveDataToFile` in the `VcfExport` class.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Choice of export file types. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: vCard and XML files are supported +
**Pros**: Easy to implement as XML file creation is already built into Address Book 4. vCard files are also relatively easy to create. +
**Cons**: Limited files types supported +

**Alternative 2**: Include .csv file types +
**Pros**: More file types to choose from for the users. +
**Cons**: Relatively harder to create a csv export file.

---

**Aspect**: Interoperability of vCards. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: vCards created by Rubrika are only expected to be readable by Rubrika.
**Pros:** Relatively easier to implement, as long as the `Import` function is able to take in the fields created by the `Export` function. +
**Cons:** Export file might not work on other applications.

**Alternative 2**: Allow vCard exported to be used universally. +
**Pros:** More usability of vCard export. +
**Cons:** Extremely difficult to implement as vCards have many variation of formats across different application.

// end::importexport[]

// tag::findtag[]
=== FindTag Function

The find tag function is done by the `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` class which lies under `Model`.

`TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` will iterate through each person and returns true for the person that has the tags similar to the keywords.

In the method `execute()` under `FindTagCommand`, the predicate is then used to update the filtered list when it is parsed into the method `updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate)` which belongs to the `Model` class.

The filtered list size is then parsed into the `getMessageForPersonListShownSummary(int)` which will return the `CommandResult` to show to the user.

image::FindTagComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.9.1 : Sequence Diagram of FindTag function_
[NOTE]

The `FindTag` command is not undoable so it will just override `execute()`.

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Implementation logic of `FindTag`. +
Alternative 1 (current choice): Keywords(case-insensitive) that are substrings or equal to the tag names will match. +
Pros: Easy and convenient for users to search for specific tags. +
Cons: If the user only type a common letter or substring found in all tag names, more persons will be returned which makes it difficult to search for the specific tag. +
Alternative 2: Only keywords(case-sensitive) that are exactly equal to the tag names will match. +
Pros: Results in an accurate filtered list. +
Cons: Requires user to type the exact tag name which makes it inconvenient. As convenience is more important, Alternative 1 is chosen.
// end::findtag[]
// tag::remarks[]
=== Remarks Function

The `Remarks` function is done by calling `RemarkCommand` that take in a `Remark` and make use of `RemarkCommandParser`that parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.

`RemarkCommand` that extends `UndoableCommand`.

Three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()` in `Person`, which implements the `ReadOnlyPerson` interface.

`XmlAdaptedPerson` have a `Remark` field to save `Remark`.

// end::remarks[]
// tag::theme[]
=== Theme Function

The `theme` Function is done by Calling `ChangeThemeCommand` that take in a `String` that specify the type of theme the user want to change to.

`ChangeThemeEvent` is then executed which triggers `handleChangeTheme` in `MainWindow`.

`handleChangeTheme` check remove all Stylesheets that are not the one specified by the user and add the Stylesheet user specified.

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Implementation logic of `theme`. +
Alternative 1: Have a dropdown menu UI for user to select the theme they want. +
Pros: Easy and convenient for users to choose and see themes available. +
Cons: Go against the deign principle of Command Line Interface. +
Alternative 2: User have to input the theme style they want in the command box. +
Pros: Follow the design principle of Command Line Interface. +
Cons: Requires user to type more and remember which theme is available.
// end::theme[]
== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose to use asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

Take a look at <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.

Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

Check out <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.3.1 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run '<whatever tests selected>'` as shown below:

image::intellij-tests.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.1.1 : Selecting a package of tests to run in IntelliJ_

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
[[suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started]]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

[TIP]
Before proceeding, please ensure that you have read through the link:#settingup[Setting up] and link:#design[Design] sections of the developer guide.

We recommend that new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like how we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you will need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
* See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
* See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
* See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
* See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to show the total number of people in the address book.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
* See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
* See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.
