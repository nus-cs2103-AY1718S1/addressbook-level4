== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::ui[]
=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonDisplayCard`, `StatusBarFooter`, `AddressPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The color scheme of the `UI` component is determined using the css files `DarkTheme.css` and `LightTheme.css`.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
// end::ui[]

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data and Recycle Bin data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that is derived between the Address Book data and the Recycle Bin data depending
on the list being displayed. This data can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// tag::storage[]
=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

image::AddressBookDataClassDiagram.png[width="400"]
_Figure 2.5.2 : Structure of Data Storage_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `AddressBookData` object of OneBook, which holds both the address book data and recycle bin data, in xml format and read it back.
* can save a backup copy of the xml data that will be loaded in situations where the main xml data is corrupted.
// end::storage[]

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

//tag::addoptionalfields[]
=== Add Contact with optional fields
The `add` function is implemented by `AddCommand`. The `add` function has been enhanced to allow the user to add certain fields into the contact. For the fields that the user does not want to input, no prefixes for the field will be entered. The class `AddCommandParser` will interpret it as a null value and assign the string '-' to the following field. This will represent that the field is not assigned.

The `name` field is compulsory.

The fields that are not compulsory are `phone`, `birthday`, `email`, `address`, `organisation`, and `tags`.
//end::addoptionalfields[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism

The `find` function is implemented by `FindCommand`, which updates the list of displayed contacts. `FindCommandParser` checks that the KEYWORDS entered are valid, then passes a predicate from `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` into `FindCommand`. +

Given below is the Sequence Diagram that shows how the `find` operation works: +

image::FindPersonDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6.1 : Sequence Diagram for find operation_

The designated fields allowed are: +

* `name` +
* `address` +
* `email` +
* `phone number` +
* `birthday month` +
* `organisation` +

**Aspect:** Command keywords. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Allow user to search each field using specific keywords. +
**Pros:** More utility is given to users as they can find their contacts using specific keywords for the individual fields. +
**Cons:** Too many main keywords for users to remember. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow user to search for all fields without specific keywords. +
**Pros:** No extra keywords to remember. +
**Cons:** Search may end up overlapping with other unwanted fields, giving a less precise search.
// end::find[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The `sort` function is implemented by the `SortCommand`, which sorts the OneBook contact list by name or email alphabetically.
There is a `SortCommandParser` which checks for the KEYWORD which must be either name or email.
When a user wants to sort the address book by name, the logic manager will execute the command by parsing the command to the other classes accordingly as shown in the figure below.

image::SortPersonDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.7.1 : Sequence Diagram for sort operation_

When SortCommand is executed, it will call executeSort() in the ModelManager. The executeSort() will call executeSort in Addressbook and finally, sort() method will be called in the UniquePersonList will sort the AddressBook alphabetically.

==== Design considerations
**Aspect:** What fields to be sorted. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  allows user to sort name and email only. +
**Pros:** Sorting by name or email is the most common, so users do not need to remember the many sorting options. +
**Cons:** Users do not have the freedom to select what fields to be sorted according to. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow users to sort all fields. +
**Pros:** Users have the freedom to select what fields to be sorted according to. +
**Cons:** Not useful as most users sort by name only.
// end::sort[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Delete mechanism

The `delete` function is implemented by `DeleteCommand`. The function has been enhanced to allow multiple deletions at once. `DeleteCommandParser` returns a `DeleteCommand` with an array of indexes which are taken from the user input. `DeleteCommand` then executes the deletion of the respective persons.

The indexes given by the user must be separated by a comma for multiple deletions.
// end::delete[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import mechanism

The `import` function is implemented by `ImportCommand`, which imports the contacts in a VCard file to Onebook. It imports a VCard file from a valid directory which the user need to input after keying "import" command in the command box. Inputting a directory is easier than asking the user to put the VCard file in a specific directory.
The format in the VCard file is checked to ensure that it is valid before importing it to OneBook. The fields that are currently imported from VCard file are: +

* `name` +
* `address` +
* `email` +
* `phone number` +
* `birthday` +
* `organisation` +
* `remarks`

The `ImportCommandParser` will check if the file directory exist and whether the extension is correct. Then it will  create a new `ImportCommand`.
When ImportCommand is executed, it will call importFile() in Model as shown in the diagram below.

image::ImportDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.8.1 : Sequence Diagram for import operation_

The Model Manager will then call getPersonFromFile() in ImportVCardFile. It will return an ArrayList of Person which will be added to OneBook using addPerson() in Model Manager. There is an importAnalysis object to track the number of contacts that are successfully imported from the file as well as track if there are duplicated contacts or information in contacts with invalid format.

==== Design considerations
**Aspect:** Which file formats to allow to import. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow VCard file. +
**Pros:** VCard file has a format for each field, which makes importing easier. Some file formats such as csv does not have common heading standards which make import difficult. +
**Cons:** Users can only import VCard file. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow all contact file formats. +
**Pros:** Users can import contacts in the different file formats that have. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement since file formats such as csv does not have common heading standards.
// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export mechanism

The `export` function is implemented by `ExportCommand`, which exports the contacts in Onebook to a VCard file. It exports a VCard file to a valid directory which the user need to input after keying "export" command in the command box. Inputting a directory is easier for the user so user would know where to find the exported file.
The fields that are currently exported to VCard file are: +

* `name` +
* `address` +
* `email` +
* `phone number` +
* `birthday` +
* `organisation` +
* `remarks`

The `ExportCommandParser` will check if the file directory exist and whether the extension is correct. Then it will  create a new `ExportCommand`.
When ExportCommand is executed, it will call exportFile() in Model.

image::ExportDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.9.1 : Sequence Diagram for export operation_

The model manager will then call either createCsvFile() in ExportCsvFile if the file extension is .csv or createVCardFile() if the file extension is .vcf.
ExportCsvFile will create a .csv file with the contacts information from OneBook and createVCardFile() will create .vcf file with contacts information from OneBook. The file will be created in the file directory specified by the user.

==== Design considerations
**Aspect:** Which file formats to allow to export. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow VCard file and csv file. +
**Pros:** csv file and VCard file format are the most common file formats for contacts which makes it easy for users to import to other contact applications. +
**Cons:** Users can only export VCard file or csv file. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow user to export to all other file formats. +
**Pros:** Users can choose which file format they want to export as. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement there are alot of file formats to implement for export.
// end::export[]

// tag::email[]
=== Email mechanism
The email function is implemented by the EmailCommand, which will fill in the email address in the compose message in user’s desktop default application.
Users will key in email index where index refers to the index of the person listed in the PersonListPanel which they wish to email to. It will be parse through AddressBookParser and EmailCommandParser to extract the index. A new EmailCommand will be created and the EmailCommand open user’s desktop default mail application.

==== Design considerations
**Aspect:** How should the email work. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** opened via user’s default desktop application. +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement. Most operating system such as Windows or MacOS have a email application installed. +
**Cons:** Users need to make sure the email application such as Microsoft outlook is their desktop default application. Users need a email application on their desktop/computers. +
**Alternative 2:** email directly from the command box using Java Mail API. +
**Pros:** Users do not need to get out of java application to send an email. +
**Cons:** If users need to type long messages, it will be problematic as the command box is not long enough to preview the whole message at once.
// end::email[]


// tag::bin[]
=== Recycle bin
The recycle bin is implemented by having OneBook store the list of person deleted using a separate list from the main address book list. +
This list is implemented via extending `AddressBook` class.

To support display of `RecycleBin`, two separate `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` are stored in `Model`. One of the list contains the `AddressBook` contacts,
while the other contains the `RecycleBin` contacts. The displayed `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` switches between the two depending on which mode is being displayed.
This allows for `find` and `sort` to retain compability between regular display and bin display. +
The diagram belows shows the sequence of execution when `bin` is executed.

image::BinListDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.11.1 Sequence Diagram for bin operation_

The `RecycleBin` is one of the components of `AddressBookData` that is saved in the `addressbool.xml` file for storage. When `AddressBookData` is loaded,
data for `AddressBook` and `RecycleBin` are both loaded.

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `RecycleBin` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new type of list `RecycleBin` extending from `AddressBook` +
**Pros:** We will be able to store additional information in the list. Existing methods for `AddressBook` can still be used. +
**Cons:** Increases workload as a new class is added. Testing of newly introduced class is also required. +
**Alternative 2:** Just reuse `AddressBook` to store a separate list for `RecycleBin` +
**Pros:** Does not require alot of code changes. +
**Cons:** Unable to add additional fields to `RecycleBin` entry. Increases coupling between `RecycleBin` and `AddressBook` which is undesired. +

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of commands for `RecycleBin` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new group of commands specifically for `RecycleBin` usage with `bin` as the first part of each command. +
**Pros:** Less mixup in command purpose. Commands will look more organized. Existing command naming can be reused. +
**Cons:** A new parser will have to added for each command that determines the command is for `RecycleBin`. +
**Alternative 2:** Add a new command using unused command words for each feature of `RecycleBin` usage. +
**Pros:** Commands will not have `bin` in front of each of them, making them less repetitive.. +
**Cons:** Commands will be easily mixed up. Purpose of command will be unintuitive, `clear` may mean to clear recycle bin or to clear address book. A separate command name for clearing recycle bin need to be thought of (clear can no longer be used). +
// end::bin[]

//tag::backup[]
=== Backup AddressBook
When OneBook is launched, the system will look for the main data file to open.

If the main data file is able to open, it will create a backup copy of the main file from the `StorageManager`.

There is no implementation for the backup function. It will happen on every start up of the application.
//end::backup[]

//tag::modechange[]
=== Change mode mechanism
The `mode` function is implemented by `ModeCommand`,
which will change the background theme by replacing the current CSS and HTML files with new files.

The diagram below shows the sequence of execution when `mode` is executed.

image::modeCommand.png[width="800"]

ModeCommand will invoke a `post(ModeChangeRequestEvent)` method which will be read by `EventsCentre`.

The `MainWindow` will process the request and change the CSS and HTML files accordingly.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
