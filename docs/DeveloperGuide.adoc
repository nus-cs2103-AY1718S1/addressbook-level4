== Introduction
// tag::intro[]
ModU is a software designed to assist teachers and lecturers to plan their weekly teaching schedule.

There are many ways to improve and extend the functionality of this software and this guide provides essential information to help you get started.
This developer guide contains information of the architecture design of this software, implementation of the existing commands that are accessible for the users and other useful information
// end::intro[]

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later have to be installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. IntelliJ IDE have to be installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has link:#gradle[Gradle] and link:#javaFX[JavaFX] plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Launch IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog).
. Set up the correct JDK version for link:#gradle[Gradle].
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`).
It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message.
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up link:#travis[Travis] to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both link:#travis[Travis] and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms. +
link:#travis[Travis] is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based.

==== Getting started with coding

Before you start coding, understand the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram (Figure 1)_* above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
•	The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the `diagrams` folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the `.pptx` file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At application launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represent a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by other classes to write log messages to the application’s log file.

The rest of the application consists of four components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The user interface of the application.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : The data handler in the application.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : The storage manager.

Each of the four components

* Defines its link:#api[API] in an interface with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the Logic component (see the _link:#class-diagram[Class Diagram] (Figure 2)_ given below) defines its link:#api[API] in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2 : link:#class-diagram[Class Diagram] of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence Diagram](Figure 3)_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user executes the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3 : Sequence Diagram for delete 1 command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the Model simply raises a **AddressBookChangedEvent** when ModU data are changed, instead of asking the Storage to save the updates to the hard disk.

The _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] below (Figure 4)_ shows how the **EventsCenter** reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4 : Sequence Diagram for delete 1 command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the **EventsCenter** to the Storage and link:#ui[UI] without Model having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this event driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== link:#ui[UI component]

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5 : Class Diagram of the UI Component_

*link:#api[API]* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As shown in the _link:#class-diagram[Class diagram] above (Figure 5)_, the link:#ui[UI] consists of a **MainWindow** that is made up of subcomponents e.g. **CommandBox**, **ResultDisplay**, **PersonListPanel**, and etc. All of them inherit from the abstract **UiPart** class.

The link:#ui[UI] component uses link:#javaFX[JavaFx] link:#ui[UI] framework. The layout of these link:#ui[UI] parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view folder`. For example, the layout of the **MainWindow** is specified in `MainWindow.java`.

The link:#ui[UI] component,

* executes user commands using the Logic component.
* binds itself to some data in the Model so that the link:#ui[UI] component can auto-update when the data in the Model component changes.
* responds to events raised from various parts of the application and updates the link:#ui[UI] accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 6: Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 7: Inheritance Diagram of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning XYZCommand and Command in Figure 5_

*link:#api[API]*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]
 _(Figure 6 and 7)_


.  The Logic component uses the **AddressBookParser** class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a Command object which is executed by the **LogicManager**.
.  The command execution can affect the Model component (e.g. adding a lesson) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a **CommandResult** object which is passed back to the link:#ui[UI] component.

Given below is the _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 8)_ for interactions within the Logic component for the execution of  `"delete 1"` link:#api[API] call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 8: Sequence Diagram for the delete 1 Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 9: Class Diagram of the Model Component_

*link:#api[API]* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

_The Model component (Figure 9)_,

* stores a **UserPref** object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores all the data of ModU.
* exposes an unmodifiable **ObservableList<ReadOnlyLesson>** that can be 'observed' e.g. the link:#ui[UI] component can be bound to this list so that it automatically updates when the data in the list has changed.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 10: Class Diagram of the Storage Component_

*link:#api[API]* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component _(Figure 10)_,

* can save **UserPref** objects in json format.
* can read **UserPref** objects in json format.
* can save all other data in xml format.
* can read all other data in xml format.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an **UndoRedoStack**, which resides in **LogicManager**. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modify the state of ModU (e.g. add, edit). Such commands will inherit from **UndoableCommand**.

[NOTE]
The `undo` command does not work after `list` or `view` command. +
The `redo` command only works if the previous command is `undo`. +

**UndoRedoStack** only deals with **UndoableCommands**. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from **Command** instead. The following diagram shows the _Inheritance Diagram (Figure 11)_ for commands.

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 11: Inheritance Diagram of Commands in the Logic Component_

As you can see from the diagram, **UndoableCommand** adds an extra layer between the abstract **Command** class and concrete **Commands** that can be undone, such as the **AddCommand**. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an undoable way, such as saving the state of ModU before execution.

**UndoableCommand** contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implement the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the template pattern.

**Commands** that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The **UndoRedoStack** will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new UndoableCommand, delete 5, to delete all lessons associated with the module in index 5.
The current state of ModU is saved before executing the command.
The command will then be pushed onto the undoStack (the current state is saved together with the command) (Figure 12).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 12: undoStack Diagram 1_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are pushed onto the **undoStack**. For example, the user may execute add m/CS2103T … to add a new lesson _(Figure 13)_.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 13: undoStack Diagram 2_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed onto the **UndoRedoStack**.

Suppose that the user now decides that adding the lesson was a mistake, and wants to undo that action using undo.

We will pop the most recent command out of the undoStack, and check if the command is redoable (a command is redoable if the listing panel has not been changed). For example, delete 5 has different meaning when listing by module and location, and thus redoing the command is no longer allowed. However, if the listing element has not been changed, we will push it back to the redoStack. We will restore ModU to the state before the add command was executed _(Figure 14)_.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 14: undoStack Diagram 3_

[NOTE]
If the **undoStack** is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an exception will be thrown when trying to pop from the undoStack.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 15)_ shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 15: Sequence Diagram for undo operation_

The redo command does the exact opposite (pops from **redoStack**, push to **undoStack**, and restores ModU to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the **redoStack** is empty, then there are no other commands left to redo. In this case, an exception will be thrown when trying to pop from the **redoStack**.

The user now decides to execute a new command, clear. As before, clear will be pushed onto the **undoStack**. This time, the **undoStack** is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add m/MA1101R command` (this is the behaviour that most modern desktop applications follow) (_Figure 16_).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 16: RedoStack Diagram 4_

**Commands** that are not undoable are not pushed onto the **undoStack**. For example, list, which inherits from **Command** rather than **UndoableCommand**, will not be pushed onto the **undoStack** after execution (_Figure 17_):

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 17: RedoStack Diagram 5_

Suppose now user wants to view all lessons of module code CS2103, thus user types command view 1 (Suppose the index of module CS2103 is 1), command view will change the listing element from **MODULE** to **LESSON**. The **undoStack** will then be cleared because the user can only undo if the listing element type has not been switched _(Figure 18)_.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 18: RedoStack Diagram 6_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 19)_ summarizes what happens inside the **UndoRedoStack** when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 19: Activity Diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **UndoableCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Add a new abstract method **executeUndoableCommand()**. +
**Pros**: This implementation allows us to not lose any undo/redo functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with **Command** do not have to know that **executeUndoableCommand()** exists. +
**Cons**: It would be difficult for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2**: Override **execute()** method. +
**Pros**: This implementation does not involve the template pattern which makes it easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons**: Classes which inherit from **UndoableCommand** must remember to call **super.execute()**, or risk losing the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect**: How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Save the current state of ModU. +
**Pros**: This implementation requires less effort. +
**Cons**: It may have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2**: Undo/redo are executed by individual commands. +
**Pros**: This implementation will use less memory. +
**Cons**: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

---

**Aspect**: Type of commands that can be undone/redone+
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Include only commands that modifies the data in ModU (add, clear, edit). +
**Pros**: We only revert changes that are difficult to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons**: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing undo. +
**Alternative 2**: Include all commands. +
**Pros**: This implementation might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons**: User could not skip such commands if he or she just wants to reset the state of ModU and not the view mode.

---

**Aspect**: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use separate stack for undo/redo. +
**Pros**: This implementation makes it easy for developers who are taking over this application to understand. +
**Cons**: The Logic component is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both **HistoryManager** and **UndoRedoStack**. +
**Alternative 2**: Use **HistoryManager** for undo/redo. +
**Pros**: This implementation does not require maintaining a separate stack, thus allowing us to reuse existing codes in the codebase. +
**Cons**: It would require dealing with commands that have already been undone and we must remember to skip these commands. It also violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as HistoryManager now needs to do two things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::ListingUnit[]
=== ListingUnit mechanism

**ListingUnit** is an enumeration class which has three enumeration types: **LESSON**, **MODULE** and **LOCATION**. It records the current listing attribute of the lesson list panel. It has static method **getCurrentListingUnit** and **setCurrentListingUnit** that allows us to record the current listing type and get the current listing type at any time. It is implemented in this way:
----

public enum ListingUnit {
    MODULE, LOCATION, LESSON;

    private static ListingUnit currentListingUnit = MODULE;
    private static Predicate currentPredicate;

    //...
}
----
When list command is used, the variable **currentListingUnit** will be set accordingly, either by **LOCATION** or **MODULE**. Similarly, when view command is used, the variable **currentListingUnit** will be set to **LESSON**.

**ListingUnit** facilitates the implementation of the various parts of the Logic component, such as **EditCommand**, **ViewCommand**, **DeleteCommand** and others. For example, **EditCommand** will need to know the current listing attribute in order to parse the arguments.

ListingUnit also records the current predicate used in **filteredLessonList** and has static methods **setCurrentPredicate** and **getCurrentPredicate**. Whenever the predicate is changed, the variable **currentPredicate** will be updated accordingly.

The recorded predicate is mainly used to facilitate the implementation of **RedoCommand**. We do not allow redoing of the previous command in a different context. Since many of the commands are index-based, executing the command with a different listing type will cause different results. As a result, when implementing the redo mechanism, we can obtain the **currentPredicate** and compare it with the predicate memorised by the command and only push it onto the **redoStack** if the predicate is the same.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **ListingUnit** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Construct an enumeration class **ListingUnit** and record current listing type and predicates. +
**Pros**: It makes the implementation of many other features easier. +
**Cons**: In testing, **ListingUnit** class carries data from one test to another even when we want each test to be independent of the others. +
**Alternative 2 (previous choice)**: Use a variable in model manager to keep record of current **ListingUnit**. +
**Pros**: There is no need for an extra enumeration class. +
**Cons**: In order to access the variable in other components, the variable must be declared static. However, we cannot define static abstract methods in an interface.
// end::ListingUnit[]

// tag::list/view[]
=== List/View mechanism
The list and view mechanisms are similar and both are facilitated by **ListingUnit** and predicate. When the user lists by different attributes, the static variable current **ListingUnit** will reset to either **MODULE** or **LOCATION**, depending on the user’s input. When the user view by index, the static variable current **ListingUnit** will be set to **LESSON**.

[NOTE]
The default listing unit is **MODULE**. When listing by attribute, for example, list location, the **currentListingUnit** will be set to **LOCATION** and shows a list of all locations.

For different listing type, we always use the same **lessonList** but set different predicate to it. **UniqueModuleCodePredicate** and **UniqueLocationPredicate** are used to facilitate the implementation of list. For example, when the user types in list module, a **UniqueModulePredicate** will be used to filter the **lessonList**. link:#ui[UI] will hide all other irrelevant information of the lesson such as location and time slot and shows a list of all modules.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 20)_ shows how the list command works:

image::ListCommandSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="900"]
_Figure 20: Sequence Diagram for ListCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 21)_ summarizes what happens when a user executes list command.

image::ListCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 21: Activity Diagram for ListCommand_

**FixedCodePredicate** and **FixedLocationPredicate** are used to facilitate the implementation of **ViewCommand**. According to the current listing type, which we can obtain from **ListingUnit**, we can create either a **FixedCodePredicate** or a **FixedLocationPredicate** to filter the lesson list and set **currentListingUnit** to be **LESSON**.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 22)_ shows how the view command works:

image::ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="900"]
_Figure 22 Sequence Diagram for ViewCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 23)_ summarizes what happens when a user executes **ViewCommand**.

image::ViewCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 23: Activity Diagram for viewCommand_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **List** and **View Command** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Set different predicates to the **filteredList** and hide irrelevant information in the lesson list panel. +
**Pros**: It would be easy to understand and do not use extra spaces to store different kind of lists (For example, location list). +
**Cons**: This will increase overhead due to implementation of new predicates. +
**Alternative 2 (previous choice)**: Store lesson list, unique module list and unique location list separately and switches to different panel list before calling view command. +
**Pros**: This implementation will make the data structure more organized. +
**Cons**: Waste of space due to muptiple list is created and the switching of panel will cause heavier load to the system compared to a single panel.

// end::list/view[]

// tag::mark/unmark[]
=== Mark/Unmark mechanism

The mark mechanism is facilitated by an extra attribute **isMarked** of Lesson class. **isMarked** is a boolean attribute which indicates if the given lesson is in the marked list.

When the user mark a lesson, the specified lesson’s **isMarked** attribute will be set to true. When the user unmark a lesson, the specified lesson’s **isMarked** attribute will be set to false.

By default, when a new lesson is added, it is not in the marked list and thus the **isMarked** attribute will be set to false. The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 24)_ shows how the mark command works:

image::MarkCommandSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="900"]
_Figure 24: Sequence Diagram for MarkCommand_

You can see a list of all marked lessons by the command list marked.

[NOTE]
Each lesson is only allowed to be added into the marked list once, thus any further mark attempt will cause an exception to be thrown.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of mark/unmark +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create an extra attribute **isMarked** for each lesson to record if the lesson is in the marked list. +
**Pros**: It would be easy to implement `list marked` since we are using predicates to update the lesson list. +
**Cons**: It requires to filter out marked lessons every time. +
**Alternative 2 (previous choice)**: Stores additional marked lesson list. +
**Pros**: No do not need to filter out the marked lessons each time. +
**Cons**: Lessons might be stored two times which could potentially waste space.

// end::mark/unmark[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism

The find mechanism is facilitated by predicates. Whenever find command is executed, **FindCommandParser** will turn the parameter into a string list and passed to **FindCommand**. In **FindCommand**, different find predicates will be called depending on what the current **ListingUnit** is and updates the predicate of **filteredList** with one of the following four predicates: +

* **LocationContainsKeywordPredicate**
* **ModuleContainsKeywordPredicate**
* **MarkedLessonContainsKeywordPredicate**
* **LessonContainsKeywordPredicate**

[NOTE]
The **LocationContainsKeywordPredicate** will be used when the current **ListingUnit** is **LOCATION**. +
The **ModuleContainsKeywordPredicate** will be used when the current **ListingUnit** is **MODULE**. +
The **MarkedLessonContainsKeywordPredicate** will be used when the current **ListingUnit** is **LESSON** and **currentViewingPredicate** is marked. +
The **LessonContainsKeywordPredicate** will be used when the current **ListingUnit** is **LESSON**.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 25)_ shows how the find operation works:

image::FindCommandSeqDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 25:  Sequence Diagram for FindCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 26)_ summarizes what happens when a user executes find command.

image::FindCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 26: Activity Diagram for FindCommand_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **FindCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Find module/lesson/location based on the current **ListingUnit**. +
**Pros**: User does not always view all the lessons under **LessonListPanel**, it makes more sense for this implementation. +
**Cons**: It would requires more work to be done as implementing **FindCommand** as this implementation would need to create multiple predicates for different type of **ListCommand** attributes. +
**Alternative 2**: Find lessons based on the full list regardless of which listing attribute was executed previously. +
**Pros**: It would require less work to implement the **FindCommand** as compared to alternative 1. +
**Cons**: It does not make sense for the user as **FindCommand** will return a result that is irrelevant for the user. For example, the **LessonListPanel** shows a list of modules and when the user wants to search for module "CS1010", **FindCommand** will return a list of "CS1010" lessons instead of the module the user is trying to look for.

// end::find[]

// tag::remark[]
===  Remark mechanism

The remark mechanism is facilitated by **UniqueRemarkList**. Each time we add or delete a remark, the **UniqueRemarkList** is updated and changes are saved into storage. A filtered list is used to show remarks related to a specified module when a module is selected.

[NOTE]
Only module can be remarked, therefore user can use remark if and only if the current listing element is **MODULE**.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 27)_ shows how the remark operation works:

image::RemarkCommandSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="900"]
_Figure 27: Sequence Diagram for RemarkCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 28)_ summarizes what happens when a user executes remark command.

image::RemarkCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 28: Activity Diagram for RemarkCommand_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **RemarkCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: use a **uniqueRemarkList** similar to **uniqueLessonList**. +
**Pros**: Store all remarks as a single list thus it is easy to manage. +
**Cons**: Need to filter out a selected set of remarks when user select a specific module.

// end::remark[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The sort mechanism is executed by sorting the internalList in **UniqueLessonList** depending on the current **ListingUnit**.

[NOTE]
If the previous attribute type of list command is module, the list will be sorted by the lesson’s module code alphabetically for alphabets and in ascending order for number. Such sorting will also be applied for the location and lesson attributes. If there is no attribute in the execution of previous list command, the list will be sorted by the lesson’s module code by default.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 29)_ shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortCommandSeqDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 29: Sequence Diagram for SortCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 30)_ summarizes what happens when a user executes sort command.

image::sortCommandactivitydiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 30: Activity Diagram for SortCommand_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **SortCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Sort the **internalList** in **UniqueLessonList**. +
**Pros**: It would be easier for new developer to understand the operation of **SortCommand** execution as it is more intuitive. Prevent conflicting with other command execution which uses **internalList**. +
**Cons**: This implementation would require creation of different levels of abstraction of the same sort method in Model for a single method which results to more work. +
**Alternative 2**: Sort list by raising an event to sort the current **Observable<ReadOnlyLesson> lessonList** in **LessonListPanel**. +
**Pros**: This implementation of **SortCommand** would requires less work. +
**Cons**: This implementation could be counter intuitive for new developer who is looking at the code for the first time as normally developers would implement it in the Model component.

---

**Aspect**: Execution **of SortCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Sort list based on the attribute type of previous **ListCommand**. +
**Pros**: This implementation could allow user to sort by different attributes and work hand in hand with **ListCommand**. +
**Cons**: This implementation requires ModU to find out what attribute type was given as a attribute for previous **ListCommand** and sort accordingly which amount to more work. +
**Alternative 2**: Ignore previous list attribute type and return a list with all the details from all attributes sorted by name. +
**Pros**: This implementation of **SortCommand** would require less work. +
**Cons**: **SortCommand** will not work well with **ListCommand**.

// end::sort[]

// tag::colorKeyword[]
=== Color Keyword mechanism

The color keyword mechanism is facilitated by **EventBus**. Whenever color keyword command is executed, it will raise a **ColorKeywordEvent** via **EventCenter**. A listener in **CommandBox** will then enable or disable the highlighting of command keyword feature according to the parameter which was passed in by the user.

[NOTE]
The default setting for this feature is set as disable.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 31)_ shows how the color keyword command operation works:

image::ColorKeywordCommandSeqDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 31: Sequence Diagram for ColorKeywordCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 32)_ summarizes what happens when a user executes color keyword command.

image::ColorKeywordActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 32: Activity Diagram for ColorKeywordCommand_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **ColorKeywordCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Update boolean variable "isEnable" in the command box by calling event to set the status of this variable. +
**Pros**: Since only command box will be updated, using **EventCenter** will maintain good data encapsulation. +
**Cons**: It would be difficult for new developers to understand the **EventCenter** mechanism. +
**Alternative 2**: Declare a global boolean variable. +
**Pros**: It would be easier for new developer to design. +
**Cons**: This method breaks encapsulation and fails to follow the standard java coding style.

// end::colorKeyword[]

// tag::customise[]
=== Customise mechanism

The customise mechanism is facilitated by both the **EventBus** and an enumeration class **FontSizeUnit**. Currently, **CustomiseCommand** only supports changing the font size of the application. Each time **CustomiseCommand** is executed, it will raise a **ChangedFontSizeEvent** via **EventCenter** according to the user specified parameter as well as update the **currentFontSizeUnit**.

[NOTE]
The **FontSizeUnit** enumeration is to set a global static variable **currentFontSizeUnit** so that **PersonCard** is able to obtain the current font size whenever it is called.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 34)_ shows how the customise command operation works:

image::CustomiseCommandSeqDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 34: Sequence Diagram for CustomiseCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 35)_ summarizes what happens when a user executes customise command.

image::CustomiseCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 35: Activity Diagram for CustomiseCommand_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **CustomiseCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Update static variable **currentFontSizeUnit** to the corresponding **fontSizeUnit** and use **EventBus** to inform link:#ui[UI] of the change to **fontSizeUnit**. +
**Pros**: It only requires one global variable to records current **fontSizeUnit**. +
**Cons**: It would be difficult for new developers to understand the **EventCenter** mechanism. +
**Alternative 2**: Use a variable in model manager to keep a record of **currentFontSizeUnit**. +
**Pros**: It do not require additional enumeration class and easier for new developers to design. +
**Cons**: In order to obtain the variable from other components, the variable must be declared static. However, we cannot define static abstract method in an interface. It also does not follow Java’s standard coding style.

// end::customise[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Switch theme mechanism

The switch theme mechanism is facilitated by both the **EventBus** and an enumeration class **ThemeUnit**. Currently, **ThemeCommand** only supports changing between light (default) and dark theme. Each time **ThemeCommand** is executed, it will raise a **SwitchThemeRequestEvent** via **EventCenter** and update the **currentThemeUnit**.

[NOTE]
The **ThemeUnit** enumeration is to set a global static variable **currentThemeUnit** so that **MainWindow** is able to obtain the current theme whenever it is called.

The following _link:#sequence-diagram[Sequence diagram] (Figure 36)_ shows how the switch theme command operation works:

image::SwitchThemeSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 36: Sequence Diagram for ThemeCommand_

The following _link:#activity-diagram[Activity Diagram] (Figure 37)_ summarize what happens when a user executes theme command.

image::SwitchThemeActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]
_Figure 37: Activity Diagram for ThemeCommand_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **ThemeCommand** +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Update static variable **currentThemeUnit** to the corresponding **ThemeUnit** and use **EventBus** to inform link:#ui[UI] the change of **ThemeUnit**. +
**Pros**: One global variable that records current **ThemeUnit**. +
**Cons**: Hard for new developers to understand the event center mechanism. +
**Alternative 2**:Use a variable in model manager to keep record of **currentThemeUnit** +
**Pros**: There is no need for an extra enumeration class and it is also easier for new developers to design. +
**Cons**: In order to access the variable in other components, it must be declared static. However, we cannot define static abstract method in interface. It also does not follow Java’s standard coding style.

// end::theme[]


// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetable mechanism

**Timetable** is an enhancement of link:#ui[UI]. The role of the timetable view is to display a timetable of all the lessons listed in the display panel.

**Timetable** mechanism is facilitated by the **GridPane** properties in link:#javaFX[JavaFx].

The first row of **timetableView** is the header for time slot. In our software, the range for available time slots are from 0800 to 2000.

The generation of timetable column header is implemented this way:

[source,java]
----
 public void generateTimeslotHeader() {
        // ... generate column header for time slots ...//
    }
----

The first column of **timetableView** is the header for weekday. In our software, the range is from Monday to Friday.

The generation of timetable row header is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
    public void generateWeekDay() {
       // ... generate row header for weekday ...//
    }
----


When the view command is executed, a number of lessons will be displayed on the display panel.
In the **CombinePanel**, the **handleViewedLessonEvent()** will call **generateTimeTableGrid()** to set up the **timetableView**. The **generateTimeTableGrid()** will then obtain the grid data from **generateTimeTableData()**.After that, it will display the data onto the **timetableView**.

The generation of timetable data is implemented this way:

[source,java]
----
public void generateTimeTableData() {
        // ... initGridData() ...//
        // ... generate grid data for grid view ...//
    }
----

The generation of timetable view is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public void generateTimeTableGrid() {

        // ... generateTimeTableData(); ...//
        // ... generateTimeslotHeader(); ...//
       // ... generateWeekDay();  ...//
       // ... generate timetable view  ...//
    }
----
==== Design considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **Timetable**. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use java code to create the timetable view instead of SceneBuilder. +
**Pros**: It is more flexible to change the style or the text of the label. +
**Cons**: Since everything is written in code, you cannot visualise the layout until you run the code. +
**Alternative 2**: Use SceneBuilder to create the timetable view. +
**Pros**: It is easier to visualise the layout. +
**Cons**: There are many limitations such as unable to add time slot to span 2 columns.

// end::timetable[]

// tag::stickyNote[]
=== StickyNotes mechanism

**StickyNotes** is an enhancement of link:#ui[UI]. The role of the stickynotes view is to display information about a module.

[NOTE]
The maximum number of notes for a module is 9.

**StickyNotes** mechanism is facilitated by the **GridPane** properties in link:#javaFX[JavaFx].

When the remark command is executed, a new note will be created and linked to a module. The **handleRemarkChangedEvent()** will call **stickyNotesInit()** to set up the **stickyNotesView**. The **stickyNotesInit()** will then obtain the grid data from **noteDataInit()**. After that, it will display the data onto the **stickyNotesView**.

The generation of stickynotes data is implemented this way:

[source,java]
----
public void noteDataInit() {
        // ... generate note data for stickynotes view ...//
    }
----

The generation of stickynotes view is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public void stickyNotesInit() {

        // ... noteDataInit(); ...//
       // ... generate stickynotes view  ...//
    }
----
==== Design considerations

**Aspect**: Implementation of **StickyNotes**. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use java code to create the stickynotes view instead of SceneBuilder. +
**Pros**: The color of stickynotes can be changed easily. +
**Cons**: It might be difficult to implement for new developers. +
**Alternative 2**: Use Scene Builder to create the stickynotes view. +
**Pros**: It is easier to visualise the layout and set the properties needed. +
**Cons**: There are many limitations such as unable to show only a selected few TextArea objects.

// end::stickyNote[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The **LogsCenter** class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations. +

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration]) +
* The Logger for a class can be obtained using **LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)** which will log messages according to the specified logging level +
* Currently log messages are output through: Console and to a `.log` file. +

Logging Levels +

* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application. +
* `WARNING`: Potential problem detected which will not terminate the application but cause application oddities. +
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the application +
* `FINE`: Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g application name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json` ).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using link:#travis[Travis].

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below _(Figure 38)_.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some link:#gui[GUI] tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using link:#gradle[Gradle]*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using link:#gradle[Gradle].

*Method 3: Using link:#gradle[Gradle] (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our link:#gui[GUI] tests can be run in the headless mode. In the headless mode, link:#gui[GUI] tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *link:#gui[GUI] Tests* - These are tests involving the link:#gui[GUI]. They include,
.. System Tests that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the link:#gui[GUI]. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. Unit tests that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-link:#gui[GUI] Tests* - These are tests not involving the link:#gui[GUI]. They include,
..  Unit tests targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  Integration tests that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute link:#gradle[Gradle] task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use link:#gradle[Gradle] for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform Continuous Integration on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, ModU depends on the   Jackson library for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies can be automated using link:#gradle[Gradle]. For example, link:#gradle[Gradle] can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
