== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

<<<

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

<<<

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.

<<<

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

<<<

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

<<<

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

<<<

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person), `Storage` (e.g. export the contacts list) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

<<<

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<<<

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<<<

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

<<<

// tag::groups[]
=== Group Feature
The group feature enables users to create and delete a group in Circles. It is stored as a `Group` object which contains
a `GroupName`, which stores the group name, and a `List<ReadOnlyPerson>` which stores the group members. +

A `Group` object is stored in the `UniqueGroupList` inside the `AddressBook` class. The `UniqueGroupList` does not allow duplicate groups that have the same name in Circles.
Otherwise, it will throw a `DuplicateGroupException`. +

==== Creating a group
To create a group in Circles, the user will enter the following command: `creategroup n/GROUP_NAME i/INDEXES...`. +
GROUP_NAME will be the name of the group, and INDEXES are the indexes of the persons that you want to add into the group. +


Firstly, when a `creategroup` command has been entered in the Command Box, it enters the `CreateGroupCommandParser` class, which parses the arguments into a `GroupName` and a `List<Index>`,
containing the indexes of the persons that is being added to the group. +
The sequence diagram for `CreateGroupCommandParser` is shown below.

image::CreateGroupCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Next, the `CreateGroupCommand` class will take in the parameters parsed by `CreateGroupCommandParser`, and use the list of indexes to add the person corresponding to the index into a List<ReadOnlyPerson>.
A person will only be added to the group once, even if an index has been repeated more than once in the list. +

Then, a new `Group` will be created, and the `addGroup()` method in `Model` will add the group into Circles.
The code implementation is shown below, and is accessible in link: {repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CreateGroupCommand.java[`CreateGroupCommand.java`] +
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
        List<ReadOnlyPerson> groupMembers = new ArrayList<>();

        for (Index index: indexes) {
            if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
            }

            ReadOnlyPerson personToAdd = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
            if (!groupMembers.contains(personToAdd)) {
                groupMembers.add(personToAdd);
            }
        }
        ReadOnlyGroup newGroup = new Group(groupName, groupMembers);
        try {
            model.addGroup(newGroup);
        } catch (DuplicateGroupException dge) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_GROUP);
        }
        model.updateFilteredGroupList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_GROUPS);

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, groupName, groupMembers.size()));
    }
----

Finally, `Model` will call the `addGroup()` method in `AddressBook` to add the group into the `UniqueGroupList`.
The `addGroup()` method will then call the `add()` method in `UniqueGroupList`, which will check for duplicate groups in Circles.
Any group that have the same name will be considered as duplicates. If a duplicate group has been found, a `DuplicateGroupException` error will be thrown, and the group will not be added into Circles.
Otherwise, the group will be successfully added into Circles.
This method is shown below, and can be found in {repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/group/UniqueGroupList.java[`UniqueGroupList.java`]
[source,java]
----
    public void add(ReadOnlyGroup toAdd) throws DuplicateGroupException {
        requireNonNull(toAdd);
        if (contains(toAdd)) {
            throw new DuplicateGroupException();
        }
        internalList.add(new Group(toAdd));
    }
----

===== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of the `Group` feature +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Create a Group class to store the persons into a group +
*Pros:* Creating a separate class called `Group` will look more professional, and allows an additional UI panel to show to list of groups. Enhances the user experience.  +
*Cons:* Hard to implement, and higher risk for bugs in the application. +

*Alternative 2:* Create a tag for the group +
*Pros:* Short and easy solution to implement a group, and users can just use the `list tags` command to show the specific groups +
*Cons:* It violates the Single Responsibility Principle as tags are now being used for two different things, labels for the person as well as groups.

*Aspect:* Handling of group members inside `Group`+
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Create a `List<ReadOnlyPerson>` inside `Group` to store the group members +
*Pros:* Easy to implement, changes in the person list inside Circles will not affect the `Group`. Less coupling.+
*Cons:* Deleting of contacts in Circles will not reflect in the list inside the `Group`. +

*Alternative 2:* Link the group members to the `UniquePersonList` in `AddressBook`
*Pros:* Any changes to the contacts list will be updated immediately into the groups.
*Cons:* It will be harder to implement, and will result in more coupling.

<<<

==== Deleting a group
To delete a group in Circles, the user will enter `deletegroup INDEX`, where INDEX is the index of the group in the group list panel. +

Firstly, when a `deletegroup` command is entered in the Command Box, it enters the `DeleteGroupCommandParser` class, which parses the index of the group that is going to be deleted.
The sequence diagram for `DeleteGroupCommandParser` is shown below.

image::DeleteGroupCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Next, the `DeleteGroupCommand` class will take in the `Index` that is parsed by `DeleteGroupCommandParser` and calls the `deleteGroup()` method in `Model`.
The code implementation is shown below, and can be found in {repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteGroupCommand.java[`DeleteGroupCommand.java`]
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {

        List<ReadOnlyGroup> lastShownList = model.getGroupList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyGroup groupToDelete = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        try {
            model.deleteGroup(groupToDelete);
        } catch (GroupNotFoundException gnfe) {
            assert false : "The target group cannot be missing";
        }

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_GROUP_SUCCESS, groupToDelete.getGroupName().fullName));
    }
----

Finally, `Model` will call the `deleteGroup()` method in `AddressBook`, which will then call the `delete()` method in `UniqueGroupList` which will delete the group from Circles.
If the group cannot be found inside the `UniqueGroupList`, it will throw a `GroupNotFoundException` error to the user. This method is shown below, and can be found in
{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/group/UniqueGroupList.java[`UniqueGroupList.java`]
[source,java]
----
    public boolean remove(ReadOnlyGroup toRemove) throws GroupNotFoundException {
        requireNonNull(toRemove);
        final boolean groupFoundAndDeleted = internalList.remove(toRemove);
        if (!groupFoundAndDeleted) {
            throw new GroupNotFoundException();
        }
        return groupFoundAndDeleted;
    }
----

==== Selecting a group
To select a group in circles, users can enter the command `selectgroup INDEX`, where INDEX is the index of the group in the group list panel. +
Alternatively, users can also choose to click on the group in the group list to select it.

Firstly, when a `selectgroup` command is entered in the Command Box, it enters the `SelectGroupCommandParser` class, which parses the index of the group that is selected.

Next, the `SelectGroupCommand` class will take in the Index parsed by `SelectGroupCommandParser`, and calls the `deleteGroup()` method in `Model`.
If the Index is valid, it will post a `JumpToGroupListRequestEvent` which includes the `targetIndex` of the group that is being selected.
The code implementation is shown below, and can be found in
{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SelectGroupCommand.java[`SelectGroupCommand.java`]
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

        List<ReadOnlyGroup> lastShownList = model.getGroupList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_GROUP_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new JumpToGroupListRequestEvent(targetIndex));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SELECT_GROUP_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased()));

    }
----

Then, the `GroupListPanel` class in `UI` will handle the `JumpToGroupListRequestEvent`, and selects the `GroupCard` of the selected group.
It will also call the `setEventHandlerForSelectionChangeEvent()` method, which raises a `GroupPanelSelectionChangedEvent` event.
The code implementation is shown below, and can be found in
{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/GroupListPanel.java[`GroupListPanel.java`]
[source,java]
----
private void handleJumpToGroupListRequestEvent(JumpToGroupListRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    scrollTo(event.targetIndex);
}

private void setEventHandlerForSelectionChangeEvent() {
        groupListView.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty()
                .addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -> {
                    if (newValue != null) {
                        logger.fine("Selection in group list panel changed to : '" + newValue + "'");
                        raise(new GroupPanelSelectionChangedEvent(newValue));
                    }
                });
    }

----
Finally, the `GroupPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is handled by `ModelManager`, which will update the `filteredList` of persons, to display the group members in the group on the `PersonListPanel`.
The code implementation is shown below, and can be found in
{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager.java`]
[source,java]
----
private void handleGroupPanelSelectionChangedEvent(GroupPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    updateFilteredPersonList(person -> event.getNewSelection().group.getGroupMembers().contains(person));
    raise(new NewPersonListEvent(getFilteredPersonList()));
}
----

// end::groups[]

// tag::pinunpin[]
=== Pin Feature
The pin features enables users to pin their contacts to the top of their contact list. This will help them to access contacts that they frequently visit easily. +

A contact is considered pin when the `pinned` is `true`. `pinned` is a `boolean` variable inside the `Person` class. When a person is added into Circles, the `pinned` value will be set to `false`.
So, every contact in Circles in not pinned by default.

==== Pinning a person
To pin a person, the user will enter `pin INDEX`, where INDEX is the index of the person in the person list panel. +

Firstly, when a `pin` command is entered into the Command Box, it is parsed by `PinCommandParser`, which will return the `Index` of the target person.

Next, `PinCommand` will get the `Index`, and locate the target person.

Then, `PinCommand` will call the `pinPerson()` method in `Model`, which will set the `pinned` boolean inside `Person` to be true.
If the person is already pinned, it will show a message, indicating that the person is already pinned. +
The implementation of the code is shown below, and can be found in
{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/PinCommand.java[`PinCommand.java`]

----
 public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyPerson personToPin = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
        try {
            if (personToPin.isPinned()) {

        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_PIN_PERSON_FAILED);
        }
    }
----
After that, `Model` will sort the contact list by name, and bring the pinned contact to the top.

Finally, Circles will save the address book, as changes has been made.

==== Unpinning a person
To unpin a person, the user will enter `unpin INDEX`, where INDEX is the index of the person in the person list panel.

Firstly, when an `unpin` command is entered into the Command Box, it is parsed by `UnpinCommandParser`, which will return the `Index` of the target person.

Next, `UnpinCommand` will get the `Index`, and locate the target person.

Then, `UnpinCommand` will call the unpinPerson() method in `Model`, which will set the `pinned` boolean inside `Person` to be false.
If the person was already unpinned, it will show a message, indicating that the person is already unpinned.
The implementation of the code is shown below, and can be found in  {repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/PinCommand.java[`PinCommand.java`]
[source,java]
----
 public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyPerson personToUnpin = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
        try {
            if (personToUnpin.isPinned()) {
                model.unpinPerson(personToUnpin);
                model.updateFilteredPersonList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
                return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_UNPIN_PERSON_SUCCESS, personToUnpin));
            } else {
                return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_ALREADY_UNPINNED);
            }
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_UNPIN_PERSON_FAILED);
        }
----

After that, `Model` will sort the contact list by name, bringing the unpinned contact back to the list in alphabetical order.

Finally, Circles will save the address book as changes has been made.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of pin +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use a boolean variable to store `pin` information +
*Pros:* Easy to implement, lower risk of having a bug. +
*Cons:* Required to change the constuctors of `Person`, and modify many existing files to store the boolean `pinned` variable +

*Alternative 2:* Storing the `pin` information as a `Pinned` tag +
*Pros:* Storing the `pin` information as a tag is easy to implement, and does not cause any storage issues. +
*Cons:* Potential bug where users can add a similar tag as the pin tag, and thus, be able to pin a contact without using the `pin` command.
// end::pinunpin[]

// tag::find[]
=== Enhanced Find Command

The enhanced `find` command now allows searches for a Person's Name, Phone Number, Email, Address and Tags. It uses the
`PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` to search for the keywords in the address book. It also allows users to search for a person even when they search with an incomplete name (e.g: `find lex` will return Alex).

To search whether a person contains the specific keywords, `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` will run 2 boolean methods:

First, it will call `getSearchText()` from the `ReadOnlyPerson` class, which will return a String, and searches the String for the requested keyword.
The code implementation is shown below, and is accessible in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson.java`] +
[source,java]
----
default String getSearchText() {
        final StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        builder.append(getName())
                .append(" ")
                .append(getPhone())
                .append(" ")
                .append(getBirthday())
                .append(" ")
                .append(getAddress())
                .append(" ")
                .append(getEmail())
                .append(" ")
                .append(getEmail().getUserName())
                .append(" ")
                .append(getEmail().getDomainName());
        for (Tag tag: getTags()) {
            builder.append(" ")
                .append(tag.tagName);
        }

        return builder.toString();
    }
----
Next, it will get the Person's name by using `getName` method from `ReadOnlyPerson`, and check if the name contains the requested keyword by using `contains(CharSequence keyword)`.
If there is any match, this boolean method will return true. This method is shown below; and can be found in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate.java[`PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate.java`]
[source,java]
----
@Override
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    return keywords.stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil
            .containsWordIgnoreCase(person
            .getSearchText(), keyword))
            || keywords.stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> checkName(
            person.getName(), keyword));
}

private boolean checkName(Name personName, String keyword) {
    return personName
    .toString()
    .toLowerCase()
    .contains(keyword.trim()
    .toLowerCase());
}
----

[NOTE]
The `getSearchText` method inside the `ReadOnlyPerson` class will convert all the Name, Phone Number, Email, Address and Tags into a String, that can be used to search for the person.

// end::find[]

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Search conditions for `Person` +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Search CharSequence in person's name, and full word in all other fields +
*Pros:* By checking CharSequence only in name, and not on others, usage such as `find a` will not just show everyone that has `a` in their contact information. +
*Cons:* Typing partial email, phone number, address and tag will not show the any result. +

*Alternative 2:* Search CharSequence for all fields inside a `Person`. +
*Pros:* Partial search words will show results for any fields in contact information +
*Cons:* Usage such as `find a` will search for everything that contains `a` in a person's contact information, which is not useful for the user.

<<<

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The `sort` command now allows for the list of contacts to be sorted via phone number, name, or email in lexicographic order.
It uses the `sorted()` method included in `ObservableList.java`, with comparators defined by the developer.

To begin a sort, `SortCommand` will call `model.sort(String type)` with a String parameter. This parameter defines how the list will be sorted,
and can be one of 3 options, "name", "phone" or "email".

Next, a comparator will be chosen and passed into the `sorted()` method based on the parameter passed from the `Command`.
The methods for choosing the comparator and calling the `sortBy()` method are shown below, and can be found in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager.java`]

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void sort(String sortType) throws DuplicatePersonException {
    switch (sortType) {
    case SortCommand.ARGUMENT_NAME:
        addressBook.setPersons(sortBy(COMPARATOR_SORT_BY_NAME));
        break;

    case SortCommand.ARGUMENT_PHONE:
        addressBook.setPersons(sortBy(COMPARATOR_SORT_BY_PHONE));
        break;

    case SortCommand.ARGUMENT_EMAIL:
        addressBook.setPersons(sortBy(COMPARATOR_SORT_BY_EMAIL));
        break;

    default:
        break;

    }
    indicateAddressBookChanged();
}
----
[source,java]
----
private ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson> sortBy(Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> comparator) {
    ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson> newList = new ArrayList<>();
    updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);

    SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson> sortedList =
                getFilteredPersonList()
                .filtered(PREDICATE_SHOW_PINNED_PERSONS)
                .sorted(comparator);

    newList.addAll(sortedList);
    sortedList = getFilteredPersonList()
    .filtered(PREDICATE_SHOW_UNPINNED_PERSONS)
    .sorted(comparator);

    newList.addAll(sortedList);
    return newList;
}
----

[NOTE]
Expanding the number of ways the list can be sorted requires adding cases to the switch in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java[`SortCommand.java`]
and creating a new comparator in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager.java`]

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Methodology used for sorting +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* `ObservableList` 's `sorted()` method +
*Pros:* Easy to implement, relatively modular +
*Cons:* Dependant on Java API, future changes to the method could affect the implementation

*Alternative 2:* Override methods with own implementations; code sorting functionality directly into UniquePersonList +
*Pros:* Less dependant on provided resources, more flexible with product's requirements +
*Cons:* Resource-intensive; increases coupling between Logic and Model
// end::sort[]

<<<

//tag::delete[]
=== Deleting Multiple Contacts

A method added to previous address book as an enhancement was to be able to delete multiple contacts at a time.
This is done by creating an index that is a one-based index to read the list of people desired to be deleted instead of the default zero-based index.
The one-based index code fragment is as follow:

[source,java]
----
public static Index[] arrayFromOneBased(int[] oneBasedIndex) {
    …
    arrayIndex[i] = new Index(oneBasedIndex[i] - 1);
    }
    return arrayIndex;
}
----

Parser will need to be taught to read oneBasedIndex array into Indexand we will use the newly created array to form a new method:

[source,java]
----
public static Index[] parseDeleteIndex(String oneBasedIndex) throws IllegalValueException {
…
    for(String str : parts) {
        trimmedIndex[i] = str.trim();
        if (!StringUtil.isNonZeroUnsignedInteger(trimmedIndex[i])) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_INVALID_INDEX);
        }
    …
    }
}
----

<<<

Delete command will then need to be able to read the array in order to take in the index as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public DeleteCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    …
    Index index[] = ParserUtil.parseDeleteIndex(args);
    …
}
----

[NOTE]
Command for Delete will be updated after parsing of new array for delete function is completed in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand.java`]

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of Multiple deletion +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use an one-based array to accept deletion of multiple contacts using their index +
*Pros:* Implementation is simple +
*Cons:* Might be slower than previous delete method as it has to read from an array before executing the deletion itself +
//end::delete[]

<<<

//tag::optional[]
=== Optional Fields
Previously in the `add` function, all fields implemented are compulsory to be filled in. The function `requirednonnull()`
ensures that the method `AddCommand` does not take in any empty parameters for any fields. +
The fields which was previously required were `name`, `phone`, `birthdate`, `email` and `address`. +
 +
The enhancement for the `add` function ensures that user can add in contacts even without a full set of parameters. Only
`name` field is compulsory now. All other fields will read in empty fields and parse the parameters into the `AddCommand`,
reading it as "-" now. +

Name will stay compulsory as follow while other fields make use of the extended list
`Optional` from `import java.util.Optional` :
[source, java]
----
 try {
            Name name = ParserUtil.parseName(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME)).get();
            Optional<Phone> checkPhone = ParserUtil.parsePhone(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PHONE));
            if (!checkPhone.isPresent()) {
                phone = new Phone(null);
            } else {
                phone = checkPhone.get();
            }
            Optional<Birthday> checkBirthday = ParserUtil.parseBirthday(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_BIRTHDAY));
            if (!checkBirthday.isPresent()) {
                birthday = new Birthday(null);
            } else {
                birthday = checkBirthday.get();
            }
            Optional<Email> checkEmail = ParserUtil.parseEmail(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_EMAIL));
            if (!checkEmail.isPresent()) {
                email = new Email(null);
            } else {
                email = checkEmail.get();
            }
            Optional<Address> checkAddress = ParserUtil.parseAddress(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS));
            if (!checkAddress.isPresent()) {
                address = new Address(null);
            } else {
                address = checkAddress.get();
            }
            Set<Tag> tagList = ParserUtil.parseTags(argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_TAG));
----
Each parameter will then be taught to accept null input and read it as `-`. The implementation takes place in each field's
model. +
An example of teaching the parameter to reflect `-` in the person card is as shown below from `model/person/Address.java`:

[source,java]
----
...
public static final String ADDRESS_EMPTY = "-";
...
public Address(String address) throws IllegalValueException {
        if (address == null) {
            this.value = ADDRESS_EMPTY;
        } else {
            if (!isValidAddress(address)) {
                throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINTS);
            }
            this.value = address;
        }
    }
...

public static boolean isValidAddress(String test) {
    return test.matches(ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX) || test.matches(ADDRESS_EMPTY);
    }
----

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Optional Fields +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Extends from Optional list to each parameter and replace null field with "-" +
*Pros:* Implementation is simple +
*Cons:* May accept same name with different fields filled in as different person cards +
//end::optional[]

<<<

//tag::birthday[]
=== Birthday Parameter

A birthday parameter has been introduced to `Add` Command for users to input contact's birthdate into Circles.

The logic has been taught to accept the new parameter in `logic/commands/AddCommand.java` and `EditCommand.java`.
The parser for Birthday has been implemented in `logic/parser/ParserUtil.java` as shown below:
[source,java]
----
public static Optional<Birthday> parseBirthday(Optional<String> birthday) throws IllegalValueException {
          requireNonNull(birthday);
          return birthday.isPresent() ? Optional.of(new Birthday(birthday.get())) : Optional.empty();
      }
----

The `Person` class will then have to include `birthday` as a field:
[source,java]
----
 public Person(Name name, Phone phone, Birthday birthday, Email email, Address address, Set<Tag> tags) {
         requireAllNonNull(name, phone, birthday, email, address, tags);
         ...
 this.birthday = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(birthday);
   ...
 public Person(ReadOnlyPerson source) {
    this(source.getName(), source.getPhone(), source.getBirthday(), source.getEmail(), source.getAddress(),
    source.getTags());
----

The UI has to be edited to include a placeholder for the field in `PersonInfoPanel.fxml`:

[source,java]
----
<Label fx:id="birthday" styleClass="label-bright" GridPane.columnIndex="1" GridPane.rowIndex="2" />

----
To implement `birthday` field, the parameter is added into the Person class as shown below in the model diagram. This is
 implemented as `Birthday.c` +

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3 : Structure of the Model Component_ +

[source,java]
----
public Birthday(String birthday) throws IllegalValueException {
        if (birthday == null) {
            this.value = BIRTHDAY_EMPTY;
        } else {
            String trimmedBirthday = birthday.trim();
            if (!isValidBirthday(trimmedBirthday)) {
                throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_BIRTHDAY_CONSTRAINTS);
            }
            this.value = trimmedBirthday;
        }
    }

----

As shown in the model diagram, `ReadOnlyPerson` will have to be modified to support the `birthday` field:
[source,java]
----
ObjectProperty<Birthday> birthdayProperty();
    Birthday getBirthday();
----

In the storage aspect, new field will need to be added in the `XMLAdaptedPerson` class so that
the data will be saved even when Circles is closed:
[source,java]
----
public XmlAdaptedPerson(ReadOnlyPerson source) {
            name = source.getName().fullName;
            phone = source.getPhone().value;
            birthday = source.getBirthday().value;
            email = source.getEmail().value;
            ...
            }
----
==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Birthday Field +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* To build a new field in Person and replicate from the previous fields given +
*Pros:* Implementation is similar to `phone` field+
*Cons:* Extremely complicated regex to take into consideration of leap years and number of days in a month +
//end::birthday[]

<<<

// tag::listtag[]
=== Listing by tags
The List command was expanded to accommodate listing contacts with specific tags.
This was done through the creation of predicates based on the argument passed in when the List command is called.
The argument, being a String referring to the tag specified for listing, is passed into the `getPredicateForTags()` method shown below,
which returns a predicate to check if each person in the list has the tag.

[source,java]
----
    public Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> getPredicateForTags(String arg) throws IllegalValueException {
        try {
            Tag targetTag = new Tag(arg);
            Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> taggedPredicate = p -> p.getTags().contains(targetTag);
            return taggedPredicate;
        }  catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(Tag.MESSAGE_TAG_CONSTRAINTS);
        }
    }
----
The above method implementation can also be found at link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager.java`]

The predicate is then passed into the updateFilteredPersonList() method to subsequently update the list being displayed.
How `getPredicateForTags()` is called is demonstrated below; the snippet can be found in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ListCommand.java[`ListCommand.java`]
[source,java]
----
Predicate <ReadOnlyPerson> predicateShowAllTagged = model.getPredicateForTags(tagToList);
            model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicateShowAllTagged);
            String concat = " with " + tagToList + " tag.";
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, concat));
----

[NOTE]
The initial command, “list”, which merely displayed all the persons in the list, has now been changed to the command “list all”.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Filtering the list +
*Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Using a new predicate +
*Pros:* Implementation not too complex, easy to debug +
*Cons:* Usage is limited, will be slow if there are a large number of contacts +

*Alternative 2:* creating HashMaps for each tag to each person in the contact list +
*Pros:* O(1) implementation for filtering +
*Cons:* Extremely space-inefficient +
// end::listtag[]

<<<

// tag::expimp[]
=== Export/Import
The Export and Import commands were added to make users' data more portable and easier to back-up and restore.
This was done by redirecting the Storage component's `saveAddressBook()` and `readAddressBook()` methods to user-defined file paths.
The user input for destination file path (export) and origin file path (import) is parsed as a String through `ExportCommandParser` and `ImportCommandParser`.

[source, java]
----
public abstract class Command {
    protected Model model;
    protected CommandHistory history;
    protected UndoRedoStack undoRedoStack;
    protected Storage storage;
----

The Command abstract class was expanded on to allow access to Storage Components through StorageManager. This is what allows the
Export and Import Commands to access `storage.saveAddressBook()` and `storage.readAddressBook()`.
The code snippet shown above can also be found in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command.java`]

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Mechanism for writing to file +
*Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Expanding Command abstract class to allow Commands to have access to StorageManager methods. +
*Pros:* the addition of Storage access to Command is very unlikely to affect the implementation of other features, and makes efficient use of `StorageManager.java`. +
*Cons:* Insisting on precise directory location is rather unintuitive for most users, implementations where Windows explorer (or Finder for Mac) is called to show where to save the file would be better,
unfortunately the constraints of the module forbid us from doing so.

*Alternative 2:* Calling explorer or finder to select the directory location +
*Pros:* Intuitive method to selecting file destinations +
*Cons:* Implementation is slightly more complex, command would now be executed in 2 or more steps, which is against the project's allowance.
// end::expimp[]

<<<

// tag::setcolour[]
=== Changing Tag Colours
The `setcolour` command allows users to customise the colour of tags in Circles. +

The colours of the tags are stored as a `HashMap<String, String>` inside the `UserPrefs` class. When a `setcolour` command is called, and there is change in a tag colour,
`SetColourCommand` will call `setTagColour()` in `Model`, which updates the `HashMap<String, String>` inside `UserPrefs`.
The method `setTagColour()` is shown below, and the code can be found in {repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager.java`]
[source,java]
----
 public void setTagColour(String tagName, String colour) throws IllegalValueException {
        List<Tag> tagList = addressBook.getTagList();
        for (Tag tag: tagList) {
            if (tagName.equals(tag.tagName)) {
                tagColours.put(tag, colour);
                updateAllPersons(tagColours);
                indicateAddressBookChanged();
                raise(new NewPersonListEvent(getFilteredPersonList()));
                colourPrefs.updateColorMap(tagColours);
                return;
            }
        }
        throw new IllegalValueException("No such tag!");
    }
----
Then, the UI will be notified of the change by `NewPersonListEvent`, and updates the `PersonCard` and `PersonInfo` classes to reflect the change in colour.
// end::setcolour[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

<<<

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
