== Introduction

Welcome, fellow software developer! Thank you for taking interest in supporting our open-source software CYNC.
The CYNC community prides itself on being a friendly and helpful community for new developers.
If you ever face any issue or uncertainty in the instructions, feel free to send an email
to pohjie@cync.com so that we can sort out the issues for you and following contributors.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

Before you get started, please ensure that you have the following software and Java development
kit installed on your computer. As downloading and setting up *IntelliJ* may take up some time,
feel free to jump ahead and read through the instructions to get a rough idea of this project.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
+
[NOTE]
New to IntelliJ? We encourage you to head over to https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/meet-intellij-idea.html[IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2 Help] to fully
understand the ins-and-outs of IntelliJ.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

Now that you have both *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later and *IntelliJ* installed, you are ready to
set up the project.
//what repo

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

// Can put screenshot here

To confirm that you've successfully set up the project, do take the time to ensure
that your set up is correct and ready to run.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style
Before you actually write any code, you want to make sure that you're following our coding standards
so that whatever you've written can be easily understood by fellow developers.

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

You are encouraged to set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

Now that you've everything set up, you are ready to start coding! To help you along, we encourage you to

. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.

. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

This section aims to give you a broad overview of the purpose of various components and our
motivation for designing it that way.

=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below (_Figure 3.1.1_) explains the high-level design of the App. Read on for a quick overview of each component.

// update this diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for: +
// grammar error for 2 lines below
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below, _Figure 3.1.2_) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[#ui-component]
=== UI component

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

Refer to _Figure 3.2.1_ below to get a better visual overview of the UI component.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[#logic-component]
=== Logic component

The Logic Component concerns itself primarily with processing of commands and giving the relevant output.
You may wish to look at _Figure 3.3.1_ to gain a broad overview of the Logic component,
followed by _Figure 3.3.2_ to better understand the implementation of Commands in the Logic Component.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

Below is a simple explanation of what happens when user enters a command.

*API* :
link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

In case you are still feeling lost, we have provided a Sequence Diagram (_Figure 3.3.3_) to illustrate interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

[#model-component]
=== Model component

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component of CYNC is an independent component as it does not depend on the other four components, its functions are:

* Storage of  `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences such as the GUI settings
* Storage of CYNC's data
* Exposing of unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

Refer to _Figure 3.4.1_ below for an overview of the Model component.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

[#storage-component]
=== Storage component

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage[`storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

Refer to _Figure 3.5.1_ below for an overview of the Storage component.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

[#external-component]
=== External component

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/external[`external.java`]

The `External` component,

* consist of Gmail API : Authenticate user's Google account, create and send out emails
* consist of Google Calendar API : To authenticate Google account, edit and add events to google calendar
* consist of twilio API:

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

==== Motivation

The undo/redo mechanism was implemented to allow users to undo/redo a mistake in entering the commands,
instead of having to `delete` the user and `add` a corrected entry.

==== Mechanics
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following figure (_Figure 4.1.1_) shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Relevant classes in the Logic component that enable undo/redo commands_

From the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2 : Illustration of the undoStack_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3 : Illustration of the undoStack with more commands_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4 : Illustration of the redoStack_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram (_Figure 4.1.5_) shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.5 : Sequence diagram for the undo operation_

The `redo` operation does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.6 : Illustration of the undoStack during a clear operation_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.7 : Illustration of the undoStack during a list operation_

The following activity diagram (_Figure 4.1.8_) summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.8 : Activity Diagram for undoStack upon a new command_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

==== Motivation
Logging can be very useful for identifying bugs / failure points in the app.

==== Mechanics
We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue running the app, but would be safer to rectify the issues brought up by the warnings.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[#configuration]
=== Configuration
In the event where you want to change certain properties of the application (e.g App name, logging level)
you can do so by editing the configuration file (default: `config.json`) located in the root folder.

== Features Implementation

// tag::commandprediction[]
=== Command Prediction Mechanism

The `CommandPredictionPanel` updates it's contents to show relevant command predictions to the user
every time the user changes the content of the `CommandBox`. This is illustrated in the image below.

image::command-prediction-1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : Screenshot of the Command Prediction Panel_

The Command Prediction Mechanism's implementation is purely on the front-end,
ie. it only interfaces with the UI component.

Whenever the application detects a change in the contents of the `CommandBox` UI Component,
it fires a `CommandBoxContentsChangedEvent` to the `EventsCenter`.
This event is handled in the `CommandPredictionPanel` UI Component, which calls `updatePredictionPanel` internally
and updates itself to show the new command predictions (if there are any command predictions).
This is illustrated in the diagram below.

image::command-prediction-panel-sequence-diagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.2 : Sequence Diagram of the Command Prediction Panel_

==== Implementation

Whenever the contents of the CommandBox is changed, it fires a `CommandBoxContentsChangedEvent`.
The `CommandPredictionPanel` then handles this event by finding the commands that begin with the existing text in the Command Box.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect**: The database of available command predictions should be open to extension +

**Alternative 1 (Current implementation)**: Store all the available commands in a list to parse through +
**Pros**: Simple to implement, reduces coupling between components +
**Cons**: Can result in bugs if this list is not updated periodically +

**Alternative 2** : A `CommandManager` will keep track of all existing commands.
The `CommandPredictionPanel` should update it's database automatically whenever a new command is added +
**Pros**: More automation, less prone to bugs in the `CommandPredictionPanel`. The app also becomes more open to extension +
**Cons**: This implementation is more coupled and may cause some bugs in `Command` if it is not handled carefully +
//end::commandprediction[]

//tag::massemail[]
=== Mass Emailing Mechanism

The `email` command allows the user to send emails to all or certain groups of customers at once.
The emailing service is being facilitated by the Gmail Java API.

There are two types of mass emailing commands: +
1. `email all` : get everyone's email in CYNC

2.`email KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS]`: get all the required persons emails

The mass emailing mechanism is event driven. When a valid `email` command is entered, it will post a `massEmailRequestEvent` to the `Events Center`
which will be handled by the `UI Manager` by displaying the `EmailPanel`.

An email array that consists of desired customers' emails will also be pass to UI to be displayed in the `To:` textbox.
The `EmailPanel` will appear in the `MainDisplayPanel` area as seen in the diagram below.

image::email.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.2.1: Screenshot of CYNC upon entering the email command_

After the user composes an email and clicks on the `send` button, a `SendEmailRequestEvent` is fired to the
`EmailManager`, which follows the Facade design pattern. It will interact with the
`GmailApi` which handles the actual sending of the emails. This is demonstrated in the sequence diagram below.

image::massemailmech.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.2.2: Sequence diagram upon clicking the `send` button on the email Panel_

Once the emails are send out successfully, the `EmailManager` will fire an event `NewResultAvailableEvent` to indicate success to user.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Emailing platform to use +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Gmail email service +
**Pros:** Gmail is the must used and free email service around the globe. Since the Calender feature also requires Google account, using Gmail, will allow users to use both features with 1 account. +
**Cons:** Limited to only sending emails through Gmail. +
**Alternative 2:** OutLook email service +
**Pros:** OutLook is also a common email service used by many, able to send emails through OutLook. +
**Cons:** User must have an Outlook account and Google account to use emailing and Calender function.

//end::massemail[]

//tag::smscommand[]
=== SMS mechanism
==== Description
The SMS command allows the user to SMS multiple customers at once.
The SMS service is being facilitated by the Twilio Java API.

==== Implementation
There are two types of SMS commands: +
1. `sms all` : Send an SMS to every contact being stored in CYNC +
2.`sms <TAG> [MORE TAGS]`: Send an SMS to all persons containing the tags as specified in the command

On entering an `sms` command, the `SmsPanel` will appear in the `MainDisplayPanel` area,
with the phone numbers of the SMS targets extracted from the relevant persons and
pre-filled, as demonstrated in the diagram below.

image::SmsCommandScreenshot1.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.3.1: Screenshot of CYNC upon entering the SMS Command_

After the user composes an SMS and clicks on the `send` button, an event is fired to the
`SmsManager`, which follows the Facade design pattern and in turn interacts with the
`TwilioApiHelper` which handles the actual sending of the SMS.

Upon sending or failure to send the SMS, a `NewResultAvailableEvent` is fired
to update the `ResultDisplay` and let the user know if the SMS has been successfully sent or not.

This is demonstrated in the sequence diagram below.

image::SmsCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.3.1: Sequence diagram upon clicking the `send` button on the SmsPanel.
Note that the `NewResultAvailableEvent` fired by the `TwilioApiHelper` has been omitted for clarity._


//end::smscommand[]

//tag::listalltags[]
=== List All Tags mechanism

==== Description

The feature `listalltags` allows the user to view all the tags in the unique tag list.
This helps the user to check that he/she is not adding any similar and undesired tags.

==== Implementation

The List All Tags mechanism is facilitated by the `EventsCenter`. `EventsCenter` posts an event from `listalltags` command
and send the update to the `MainWindow` so that the tags can be displayed in the `browserPlaceholder`.

The mechanism is illustrated in the diagram below.

image::ListAllTagsUpdatedSD.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.4.1 List All Tags sequence diagram_
The `listalltags` command inherits the abstract `Command` class.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. Then the set-up of the application will look like the picture below.

image::CyncStartUpNew.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.4.2: Empty `browserPlaceholder` on startup_

As we can see from the above diagram, the `BrowserPanel` is initially empty. +
Upon calling `listalltags`, `browserPlaceholder` is filled to show the list of tags.

image::CyncListAllTags.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.4.3 List of tags displayed to the right of person list_

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Where the `Tag` list is displayed. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** In the `BrowserPanel`. +
**Pros:** User can see both the `Person` list and `Tag` list side by side, facilitating the sifting of information of his customers. +
**Cons:** User loses functionality of the `BrowserPanel`, in which the user is unable to use the `BrowserPanel` to see the detailed information of his client. +
**Alternative 2:** List the tags in the return message of the command, under the command box. +
**Pros:** User retains functionality of `BrowserPanel`, whereby the user can still click on the person to find out more information. +
**Cons:** This is less aesthetically pleasing. With many tags, it may be harder for the user to see the desired tag.

// end::listalltags[]



// tag::personinfo[]
=== PersonInfo mechanism

==== Description

The PersonInfo feature allows the user to see more detailed information regarding a specific customer.
In future editions, we hope to have more attributes about the customer, such as exact dates of attendance.

==== Implementation

Upon using the `select` command, `JumpToListRequestEvent` is posted by `EventsCenter`.
When `MainWindow` receives this event, it will respond by clearing the `browserPlaceholder` and calling `PersonInfo`.
`PersonInfo` will show the selected person's attributes. +

Figure 5.5.1 below shows the sequence diagram. +

image::PersonInfoUpdatedSD.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.1: Sequence diagram of PersonInfo implementation_

This is an example of the MVC design pattern,
whereby the user interacts with the `commandBox`, which then parses and execute the `SelectCommand`.
It is followed by the `MainWindow` updating the `browserPlaceholder` to show the
correct view to the user. This decouples the components involved in processing commands and showing the results
to the user.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** The presence of the `BrowserPanel` which is used to fill up browserPlaceholder on initialisation of application. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** We keep `BrowserPanel`, and instead clear `browserPlaceholder` and fill with `PersonInfo` when needed. +
**Pros:** By keeping the BrowserPanel, we do not have to post a `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` stub on the intialisation.
Hence the BrowserPanel is only responsible for displaying a blank page at startup, and the PersonInfo for displaying a person's detailed information
 when needed. This follows the Separation of Concern principle. +
**Cons:** This may be seen as a violation of the YAGNI principle, as the BrowserPanel's other functionalities are not actually used in user execution. +
**Alternative 2:** Remove the BrowserPanel and instead initialise an empty PersonInfo at start-up. +
**Pros:** Since `BrowserPanel` essentially only has one function that is seemingly trivial, it may make sense just to totally remove it.
 This decreases the amount of code that we have and also reduces the possiblity of bugs. +
**Cons:** As mentioned above, we have to post an artificial stub so that the PersonInfo will be loaded on startup.
This may violate the single responsibility principle, since PersonInfo may have to change when the start-up conditions or
the specifics of `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` change.

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar mechanism
==== Description
The calendar mechanism integrates with Google Calendar, and allows the user to view / add upcoming events.
The calendar service is facilitated by the Google Calendar API.

==== Implementation
There are two types of calendar commands: +
1. `calendar` : Displays the google calendar in the browser window +
2. `addevent <EVENT DETAILS>` : Adds a event according to the given details to the google calendar

==== Command `calendar`
Upon entering the `calendar` command, the `CalendarPanel` will appear in the `MainDisplayPanel` area,
showing the user's google calendar, or a google login page if it is first time the command is used after
the app is restarted. As demonstrated in the two diagrams below.

image::CalendarLogin.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.3.1: Upon first use of the command after every restart_

image::Calendar.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.3.2: Subsequent usages of the command after logging in_

After the `calendar` command is entered, an `event` is sent to the `EventsCenter`, which sends an update to the `UI`
such that the google calendar can be displayed in the `MainDisplayPanel`. As demonstrated in the diagram below.

image::calendarCommand.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.3.3: Sequence diagram for the execution of `calendar` command_

==== Command `addevent`
Upon entering the `addevent` command with the correct parameters, an `event` is sent to the `EventsCenter`, which sends
an update to `AddEventManager`, which follows the Facade design pattern and interacts with the `CalendarApi` for
google calendar to add the event. If the calendar event is added successfully, an `event` is
sent to the `UI` to refresh the calendar. As demonstrated in the diagram below.

image::addEvent.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.4.1: Sequence diagram for the execution of `addevent` command_

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Placement of the `calendarDisplayPanel` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replaces the `mainDisplayPanel` +
**Pros:** Users can see the `PersonListPanel` side by side with the calendar.
Users can use other functions involving the `PersonListPanel`, such as `add` and `find`, with the calendar open. +
**Cons:** Calendar is open all the time unless a command changes the `mainDisplayPanel`, this results in more resources consumed as it is
left running when not needed. +
**Alternative 2:** An overlay that covers both the `mainDisplayPanel` and the `PersonListPanel` +
**Pros:** Calendar is switched out when another command is entered, this saves resources when the calendar is not needed. +
**Cons:** Users are not able to refer to the data on the `PersonListPanel` when using the calendar.

// end::calendar[]

// tag::findfunction[]
=== Find Mechanism
==== Description
The `find` command is the filter function for this application. It will filter through all fields of the user data
based on the given keywords.

==== Implementation
The `find` command works as such: `find KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS]` +

After the command is entered, the keywords will be sent to the `parser` which then creates a `predicate` to filter
the stored data. +
The `predicate` is used by the `model`, which returns a list of filtered people based on the given `predicate`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How to provide the user with functions to search through different fields of customer data +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** All-in-one search function. +
**Pros:** Intuitive and easy to remember. Users can search through any fields of customer data with a single function. +
**Cons:** User is unable to restrict the search to only one field in the customers' data. E.g. If the user is searching
for people with addresses in `East Coast`, if there is someone whose name contains `East Coast`, it will show up as well. +
**Alternative 2:** Multiple search functions. +
**Pros:** The user can specify exactly which field he wants to search in, avoids the kind of situation described above. +
**Cons:** Not very intuitive. It is a hassle for the users to remember many different search functions.

// end::findfunction[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

It is highly important to build a stable and effective software system for both users and developers of CYNC.
As such, we have dedicated a section on testing to aid you on writing and executing your test cases.

[TIP]
It is recommended for you to test the software after every update you make.

=== Running Tests

We have three methods for you to run tests on the software.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is this method. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. This allows you to do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

* To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

// tag::testingTips[]

**Problem: Tests fail with a `GuiRobot$EventTimeoutException`. **

* Reason: The tests are taking a longer time to load than the given `waitForEvent` timeout limit.
* Solution: To give it more time, increase the `DEFAULT_WAIT_FOR_EVENT_TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS` in `src\test\java\guitests\GuiRobot.java`.

**Problem: GUI tests fail randomly using JUnit test runner.**

* Reason: Shifting of mouse / switching tabs during the test may have interrupted with the tests.
* Solution: Recommended to run tests in headless mode. You can do so by opening the console and running the command
`gradlew clean headless allTests`.

// end::testingTips[]

== Dev Ops

Here are a few things that you should take note of when making updates.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing.

* Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives: +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).

[appendix]
== Suggested Starting Point

Here is a suggested path for new developers:

1. Add small link:#local-impact-enhancements[local-impact enhancements] to one component at a time. +
Learning Outcome: To understand how each component functions. +
Some enhancements suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving each Component].

2. Add a feature that touches multiple components. +
 Learning Outcome: To learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. +
 The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[#improving-each-component]
=== Improving each component

Exercises in this section aims to help you understand the 4 major components of CYNC. Each exercise is component-based thus you would not need to modify the other components for it to function.

==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****


==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****


==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to show the total number of people in the address book.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.
****


==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.

[#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark'
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. The command will only function after adding the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
