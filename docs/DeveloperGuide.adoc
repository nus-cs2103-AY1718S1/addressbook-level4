== Software overview

Augustine is a virtual address book that assists students who are currently pursuing their studies in National
University of Singapore (NUS). Users can take advantage of Augustine to better manage aspects of their daily lives by easily
keeping track of their friends' contact information, no longer requiring a physical address book for their social needs.

In Augustine, users primarily communicate with the software via a command-line interface (CLI). Augustine also provides
users with visual feedback via a graphical user interface (GUI).

Developed in Java, Augustine will run on Windows and Unix environments, catering to all students in NUS.

== About

This Developer Guide will assist both experienced and new developers who are either interested in contributing to
the software's development or simply wish to know more about its underlying mechanisms.

The Developer Guide will first cover the prerequisites to setting up Augustine, before laying out the
various components in Augustine, providing an in-depth explanation of the features' implementation and design
considerations, documenting what the development team have undergone to make Augustine what it is today.

== Getting started
Before proceeding further with the Developer Guide, ensure that you have achieved the following requirements:

=== Setting up the prerequisites
Please install the following:

. *Java SE Development Kit* (JDK) `v1.8.0_60` or later. +
You can download the latest JDK
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here].

[NOTE]
Augustine will *not work* with any version of Java earlier than `Java 8.6`.

[start=2]
. *IntelliJ IDEA* Integrated Development Environment (IDE). +
You can download IntelliJ IDEA  https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[here].

[NOTE]
Both the *Ultimate* and *Community* versions of IntelliJ would work.

By default, IntelliJ already includes the Gradle and JavaFX plugins. Ensure that both plugins are enabled.
If you have disabled them, go to `File > Settings > Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. *Fork* this repository to your own GitHub account, and *clone* the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ and you should see the Welcome Screen.

[NOTE]
If you do not see the welcome screen, click `File > Close Project` and close the existing project first.

. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of your JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Press kbd:[Ctrl + Tab + T] *simultaneously* to open a console in IntelliJ and execute the following command:
- For Windows   : `gradlew processResources`
- For Mac/Linux : `./gradlew processResources`

[NOTE]
The command should finish executing with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and its tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `src\main\java\seedu\address\MainApp.java` in IntelliJ and try executing a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run all tests] by right-clicking on the `src/test/java` folder in IntelliJ and choosing `Run 'All Tests'`.
*Ensure* that all test cases pass before you start coding.

<<<

=== Configuring Augustine before coding
Now that you have successfully imported Augustine's source code into your computer, complete the following before
you commence coding:

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows the coding standard set forth by https://oss-generic.github.io/process/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Java.html[oss-generic].

While IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with it, minor modifications to the default settings are required to fully comply
with our coding standard.

Apply the following modifications:

. Go to:
- For Windows/Linux : `File > Settings...`.
- For macOS         : `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences...`.
. Select `Editor > Code Style > Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the
import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`,
`import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

[TIP]
You can also configure IntelliJ to help check for style-compliance as you code. See <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>>
to learn how.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103AUG2017-W14-B2/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a
separate product instead of contributing to `CS2103AUG2017-W14-B2/main`, you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in both
`DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your forked repo.

<<<

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

CI tools such as Travis and AppVeyor should be set up to prevent integration problems during development.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> to learn how to set them up.

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor set up ensures that Augustine works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms as
Travis checks for Unix-based platforms while AppVeyor checks for Windows-based platforms.

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, understand the overall design by reading the link:#software-architecture[Architecture] section.

<<<

== Software architecture

This section covers how Augustine is designed while also providing an overview of the components in Augustine.

=== Architecture design

[caption="Figure 1: "]
.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* (Figure 1) explains the high-level design of Augustine. Below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as Picture`.

<<<

===== Overview

* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible
 for the following:

** Initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them up with each other at launch.
** Shutting down the components and invoking the clean-up method where necessary on exit.

* link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by other components. Two of those classes play an important role at the architecture level:

** `EventsCenter`: This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's EventBus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event-driven_ design)
** `LogsCenter`: This class is used by many classes to write log messages to Augustine's log file.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*]: Interacts with the user through a user interface (UI).
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*]: Executes commands specified by user.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*]: Holds the data of Augustine in-memory.
* link:#email-component[*`Email`*]: Sends emails using the JavaMail application programming interface (API).
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

====
*Structure of `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `Email` components*

Each of the five components (UI, Logic, Model, Storage and Email):

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` named after the component itself.
* Exposes its functionality through a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality through the `LogicManager.java` class.

[caption="Figure 2: "]
.Class diagram of the Logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

====

=== Architecture style

Augustine implements an event-driven architecture style as explained below.

===== Event-driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below (Figure 3) shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

[caption="Figure 3: "]
.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
`Model` simply raises an `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data is changed, instead of asking  `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 4 shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

[caption="Figure 4: "]
.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without the `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this event-driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

---

<<<

=== Components

This section is an overview of the components in the architecture.

==== UI component

[caption="Figure 5: "]
.Structure of the UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of smaller parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `LeftDisplayPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `MessageDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` and `BrowserPanel`. All of these parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX's UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching the `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

<<<

The `UI` component is responsible for the following:

* Executing user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binding itself to some data in `Model` so that the UI gets automatically updated when the data in `Model` changes.
* Responding to events raised from various parts of the application and updating the UI accordingly.

// tag::logicComponent[]
==== Logic component
The `Logic` component is where the user input is parsed and the corresponding commands called.
The newly created command is then executed, and the `Model` component may be accessed if necessary (see Figure 6).

[caption="Figure 6: "]
.Class diagram of the Logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

<<<
_Figure 7_ below shows the detailed process of how the `Command` class in the `Logic` component works.

[caption="Figure 7: "]
.Structure of commands in Logic component
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The process of the `Logic` component is as follows:

. LogicManager is called by `handleCommandInputChange` method in the `UI` component and user input is passed into LogicManager.
. LogicManager calls AddressBookParser to parse user input into two Strings: `commandWord` and `arguments`.
. AddressBookParser calls the relevant `CommandParser` which parses the arguments into a fixed format. For some commands
where this is not necessary, AddressBookParser will simply directly call the `Command` instead.

[NOTE]
  The Clear, History, Exit, Help, Undo, Redo, and Backup commands do not require parsers

. Relevant `CommandParser` then calls the actual Command to execute the user command.
. `Command` executes the user command.
. The `Model` component may then be updated depending on the command type.

[TIP]
  The `Model` component will be called by Add, Delete, Clear, Edit, Find, List, Redo and Undo command.

. The result of the `Command` which is stored in `CommandResult` will then be returned to `LogicManager`
. The `CommandResult` is then returned to `handleCommandInputChange` method in the `UI` component to be displayed to the user.

_Figure 8_ below shows the sequence diagram of the process within the component when the command
`delete 1` is entered by the user.

[caption="Figure 8: "]
.Sequence diagram within the Logic component for the `delete 1` command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// end::logicComponent[]

<<<

==== Model component

[caption="Figure 9: "]
.Structure of the Model component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component does not depend on the other three components. It is responsible for the following:

* storing a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* storing Augustine data.
* storing an `Email` component which handles sending email via the JavaMail API
* exposing an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed'. The UI can be bound to this list so
 that the it gets automatically updated when the data in the list changes.

<<<

// tag::emailComponent[]
==== Email component

[caption="Figure 10: "]
.Structure of the Email component
image::EmailComponent.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/email/Email.java[`Email.java`]

The `Email` component is responsible for the following:

* using an `EmailLogin` class to store the user's email login details.
* using an `EmailSend` class to process and send email via the JavaMail link:#API[API] through a
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (link:#SMTP[SMTP]).
* using an `EmailCompose` class to store the data of email message drafts.
* exposing an unmodifiable `MessageDraft` object which can be retrieved from the `EmailCompose` class,
 such that the `MessageDisplay` UI can be bound to this list which automatically updates when the data in the
 `messageDraft` object changes.
// end::emailComponent[]

<<<

// tag::StorageComponent[]
==== Storage component

[caption="Figure 11: "]
.Structure of the Storage component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component is responsible for the following:

* saving and reading `UserPref` objects in .json format.
* saving and reading Augustine data in .xml format.

// end::StorageComponent[]

==== Common classes

Classes shared by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some of the noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides in `LogicManager`. It supports the undoing
 and redoing of commands that modify the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands inherit from
 the `UndoableCommand` class.

===== Implementation details

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from the `Command` class instead. Figure 12 shows the inheritance diagram of commands:

<<<

===== UndoableCommands

[caption="Figure 12: "]
.Logic command class diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from Figure 12, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`.

[NOTE]
====
* Extra tasks, such as saving the state of the address book before execution, are necessary when executing
 _undoable_ commands. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while its child classes
 implements the details of the specific commands.

* This technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level details in the child classes
  is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].
====

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

The commands that are undoable are implemented this way with an extra layer:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

===== UndoRedoStack

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the fifth person from Augustine.
The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes.
The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` along with Augustine's current state.

[caption="Figure 13: "]
.Stack diagram of the UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

<<<

[caption="Figure 14: "]
.Stack diagram of the UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails to execute, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using the `undo` command.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it into the `redoStack`. We will restore Augustine to its state before the `add`
command's execution.

[caption="Figure 15: "]
.Stack diagram of the UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

<<<

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

[caption="Figure 16: "]
.Sequence diagram of the undo command
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores Augustine to its state after the command's execution).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`.
This time the `redoStack` which is originally non-empty will be purged as it no longer makes sense to redo the
`add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

[caption="Figure 17: "]
.Stack diagram of the UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

<<<

[caption="Figure 18: "]
.Stack diagram of the UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

[caption="Figure 19: "]
.Undo/Redo activity diagram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

<<<

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` class#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +

* **Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
* **Cons:** It will be hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Override `execute()` +

* **Pros:** It does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
* **Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies Augustine (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +

* **Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
* **Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +

* **Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
* **Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of Augustine and not the view. +
* **Additional Info:** See our discussion at https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Data structures used to support the undo/redo commands#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +

* **Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
* **Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +

* **Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
* **Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
====
---

// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
 and destinations.

Currently, log messages are output through `Console` to a `.log` file.
The `Logger` of a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.

The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration]).

There are four different logging levels you can choose from depending on the level of verbosity desired:

* `SEVERE` : Logs only critical errors detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Logs errors which are not crucial.
* `INFO` : Logs any noteworthy actions executed by the application.
* `FINE` : Logs fine details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. printing the entire list instead of just its size.

<<<

---

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
The config file and path is specified in the `Config` class.

The `Config` class will be initialized by the `MainApp` and the constructed `Config` object will be kept as a protected variable.
When initialized, the `Config` class will read and save the values of the parameters in the configuration file. The `MainApp` then passes the `Config` object into classes which require it (e.g. `MainWindow`).

---

// tag::optionalfields[]
=== Optional fields in a contact

A user may not know all the details of a contact when adding it to Augustine. Hence, Augustine only requires the user to know both the name
and the email of a contact. Unfilled details of a contact will be given a '-' value instead to denote that the
field was not filled up by the user.

_Figure 20_ below shows the sequence diagram of the process within Augustine when a user adds a contact.

[caption="Figure 20: "]
.Sequence diagram of add command.
image::AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

<<<

===== Implementation details

As seen in _Figure 20_ above, the `AddCommandParser` class is used to parse the input entered by the user into the different fields for a contact.

In `AddCommandParser`, Augustine will do the following: +

. Call `arePrefixPresent` method to check if the two compulsory prefixes, n/ and t/, which are used for the name and email fields respectively are
present.
.. If the two compulsory prefixes are not present, Augustine will display an error message to the user.
. Execute the `checkInput` method to determine if a field is filled by the user. If the field is not filled,
the method will give the value '-' to the field instead to denote that the field is not filled by the user.

The code snippet below shows how the `checkInput` method checks if a field is filled by the user.

[source,java]
----
private static Optional<String> checkInput(Optional<String> userInput) {
        return Optional.of(userInput.orElse(UNFILLED));
    }
----

[start = 3]
. Call the `parseField` method in `ParserUtil` to parse the user input method into the different objects required for the `Person` object.

[NOTE]
The `Field` mentioned above refers to the different field available for a contact in Augustine. E.g. name, email.

[start = 4]
. Create the `Person` object, call the `AddCommand` class and pass in the newly created `Person` object as a parameter.

The result of `AddCommand` will then be displayed to the user.

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Detection of unfilled fields in user input#

====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check if value is present, if value is not present, return a '-' as the value instead. +

* **Pros:** Simple to implement and for developers to understand. +
* **Cons:** All fields are still stored in Augustine, leading to wastage of data space as fields that are not used by the User for
each contact are still being stored. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Detect if the field exist in addressbook.xml, if the field does not exist for a contact, display the field in the PersonCard as unfilled. +

* **Pros:** It will save data space in the computer as unfilled fields are not stored in the data file. +
* **Cons:** It will be harder for developers to understand the inner workings of this feature.
====
---
// end::optionalfields[]

// tag::imagestorage[]
=== Image storage mechanism
Each contact in Augustine can be assigned a photo so that the user can easily identify a contact within Augustine. If the user did not assign a photo
to a contact, a default photo will be assigned to the contact instead.

===== Implementation details
The image storage mechanism is activated when the user executes an add, edit or delete command. Photos of all contacts in Augustine are stored in the
`data/images` folder to centralize the storage of the photos. The photos are also renamed to follow a fixed format where they are named
`contact_email_address.jpg`. By centralizing the storage of the photos and naming the photos in a standardized format,
we can easily identify the owner of each photo in the `data/images` folder.

Upon the start-up of Augustine, Augustine will create the `data/edited` folder. The purpose of this folder is to store outdated photos of the
contacts while Augustine is running and enable the restoration of a contact's previous photo when the undo function is executed.
Upon the exit of Augustine, Augustine will delete both the folder and all the photos in the folder.

===== During add command
When adding a new contact, Augustine will do the following.

. Check if the user assigned a specific photo for the contact.
.. If a photo is assigned to the contact, Augustine will copy the photo assigned into the `data/images` folder.
.. If no photo is assigned to the contact, Augustine will copy the default photo instead.
. Rename copied photo as contact_email_address.jpg
. Update the photo reference path in the Photo object of the contact.

For example. if `add n/John Doe e/john@example.com dp/photo.jpg` is executed, Augustine will copy the photo `photo.jpg` to
 the `data/images` folder
and also name the copied photo as `john@example.com.jpg`.

<<<

_Figure 21_ below shows the activity diagram of the Image Storage Mechanism during an add command.

[caption="Figure 21: "]
.Activity diagram of Image Storage Mechanism
image::AddPhotoActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]

===== During edit command
As each photo in the `data/images` folder are named in reference to a contact's email address, there is a need to update the photo if
the email or photo of the contact is updated by the user. There is also a need to ensure that the current photo of the contact remains in the
system so that the photo can be restored if an undo command is executed. Therefore, when the user edits a contact, *one* of the
4 possible cases will occur.

[IMPORTANT]
We are only concerned with whether the contact's photo and email address are updated. Thus, modifications to other
attributes are not mentioned in the cases below.

. User updates *BOTH* email *AND* photo. +
.. Existing photo of the contact is copied over to 'data/edited' folder.
.. The new photo is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_new_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact's photo is updated to the file path of the copied photo.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.
.. Contact's existing photo is copied to `data/edited` folder.
.. Contact's existing photo is deleted from `data/images` folder.

<<<

. User updates *ONLY* photo. +
.. Existing photo of the contact is copied over to 'data/edited' folder.
.. The new photo is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.

[NOTE]
The new photo for the contact will overwrite the existing photo for the contact in the `/data/images` folder.

[start = 3]
. User updates *ONLY* email address. +

===== During delete command
When a contact is deleted from Augustine, the photo of the contact will be deleted from the `data/images` folder. To facilitate the restoration of
the photo of the contact during an undo command, there is a need to ensure that the photo remains in the system. Therefore, when the user deletes a
contact, Augustine will proceed to do the following.

. Copy the photo of the contact into `data/edited` folder.
. Delete the contact from Augustine.
. Delete the photo of the contact in `data/images` folder.

====
**Alternative 2 :** Store the file path of the photo source entered by the user. +

* **Pros:** Additional storage space on the computer is not required. +
* **Cons:** Modifications such as deletion or moving of the photo source will affect the display of the contact's photo. +

=== NUSmods integration
Each contact in Augustine has a `NUSmodules` class which stores all its modules and lesson slots.
Augustine displays https://nusmods.com through the browser. The current academic year and semester is set inside `config.json`

===== Implementation details
Timetables are stored in `NusModules` class and each `Person` will have a `NusModules` if they have a timetable.
`NusModules` uses a `HashMap<String moduleCode, HashMap<String lessonType, String lessonSlot>>` to store the modules.

===== NUSmods command
Modules are added, edited and deleted using the `nusmod` command.
The command will be parsed by `NusmodCommandParser` and executed in `NusmodCommand`.
As `NusmodCommand` changes the addressbook.xml, it inherits from `UndoableCommands`.
A flag will be used to discern if the user is trying to parse a URL, add, or delete a module.

The command `nusmod 2 t/add m/CS1231 sec/2 tut/9` will modify the schedule of the second person in the list
by adding a module with the `moduleCode` CS1231 with the `lessonType` "sec" and "tut", with `lessonSlot` 2 and 9 respectively.

To edit, the same command is used, new `lessonType` and `lessonSlot` will overwrite previous data. To delete, `nusmod 2 t/delete m/CS1231` can be used.

<<<

The diagram below shows how the command handles different flags.

[caption="Figure 22: "]
.Activity diagram of NusmodsCommands
image::NusmodsCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

===== Storing NUS modules in addressbook.xml

To store in addressbook.xml, `NusModules` needs to be able to converted into XML format and back (see part in red border in Figure 23).

[caption="Figure 23: "]
.Class diagram of Storage
image::StorageClassDiagramNusmods.png[width="500"]

The data will be stored as such in the .xml file:
[source,xml]
----
<nusModule moduleCode="CS1231">
    <lesson lessonType="SEC">2</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="TUT">9</lesson>
</nusModule>
<nusModule moduleCode="CS2010">
    <lesson lessonType="SEC">1</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="TUT">2</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="LEC">3</lesson>
</nusModule>
----

Process of converting addressbook.xml to `NUSModule` (see code snippets below): ::
. In `XMLAdaptedPerson`, a ArrayList is created and each <nusModule> from addressbook.xml file will an `XMLAdaptedNusModule` in it.
. Each `XMLAdaptedNusModule` will read the moduleCode and get the corresponding list of lessons by calling `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons`
. `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons` will read the lessonType and respective lesson slot and return those values.

[source,java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedPerson {
    ...
    @XmlElement(name = "nusModule")
    private List<XmlAdaptedNusModule> nusModules = new ArrayList<>();
    ...
}
----

[source,java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedNusModule {
    @XmlAttribute
    private String moduleCode;
    @XmlElement(name = "lesson")
    private List<XmlAdaptedModuleLessons> nusLessons = new ArrayList<>();
    ...
}
----
[source,java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedModuleLessons {

    @XmlAttribute
    private String lessonType;
    @XmlValue
    private String lessonSlot;
    ...
}
----



Converting from `NUSModule` back to addressbook.xml is simply the same process in reverse.
Both `XMLAdaptedNusModule` and `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons` have methods for converting to and fro.

// tag::findMechanism[]
=== Filter and sort mechanisms

The find and list commands are facilitated by the `Model` and `Logic` components. They provide the user with the option to
filter and sort the contact list.

===== Implementation details

When Augustine starts, the contact list data are extracted from data\addressbook.xml and stored in a
`FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object in `ModelManager`. This object is referenced to a `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object which is bound to the UI of Augustine. Any changes to the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object will be reflected on Augustine UI's contact list display.

The contact list can be filtered or sorted using the mechanism below.

. [red]*Filtering contact list using find command*
+
--
The find command allows the user to filter the contact list by either name, tag or both.
The contact list data is stored in a `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object. This object can be filtered
by making use of the `java.util.stream.Stream` interface which uses a predicate to filter the
`FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object.

[NOTE]
A predicate is a lambda expression for defining the find command filter criteria.

<<<

Depending on the find command specified by the user, a different predicate statement will be
created (see code snippet below). The predicate statement will define how the contact list’s
data in the `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object is filtered.

[source, java]
----
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {

    if (!namekeywords.isEmpty() && !tagkeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return namekeywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsNonFullWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword) && person.containsTags(tagkeywords));
    } else if (!namekeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return namekeywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsNonFullWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword));
    } else if (!tagkeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return person.containsTags(tagkeywords);
    } else {
        //should not occur at all.
        return false;
    }
}
----
--

. [red]*Sorting the contact list*
+
--
The find and list commands allow users to sort the contact list by  *address*,
*email*, *name* or *tag* in alphabetical order. The `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object is referenced to a `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object which is bound to the Augustine UI. The order of the contact list's data in the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object will be the same as the list displayed in the Augustine UI.

[NOTE]
The word “referenced” means that the contact list’s data in the `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object is the
exact same as the contact list’s data in the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object. Any changes to the data in the
`FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object will be reflected in the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object.

Depending on the sort option (address, email, name or tag), the contact list will be sorted differently (see code snippet on the next page).

[source,java]

=== Email mechanism

The email mechanism is facilitated by the `Email` component. It allows the sending of email via an external library, JavaMail.
The sections below will explain how the email mechanism works and some of the design considerations.

===== Implementation details

Augustine makes use of the email command to send an email. The activity diagram shows what happens when the user enters the email command.

[caption="Figure 24: "]
.Activity diagram for email
image::EmailActivityDiagram.png[]

<<<

There are 3 classes, `EmailLogin`, `EmailSend` and `EmailCompose` in the `EmailManager` class that facilitate the email process:

* `*EmailLogin*`: Handles the storing of login details and verifies that the user’s email is a Gmail account using regular expression.
* `*EmailCompose*`: Handles the composing and drafting of email using a `MessageDraft` object which stores the email’s message, subject and recipients’ email.
* `*EmailSend*`: Handles the sending of email by setting up a link:#SMTP[SMTP] connection for sending emails via the JavaMail API.
The email is rejected if the `MessageDraft` object in `EmailCompose` is empty or the login details in `EmailLogin` is invalid.

The sequence diagram below shows how the component interacts with one another when the user enters an email command.

[NOTE]
*Email* in diagram below = `email em/message to send es/subject el/adam@gmail.com:password et/send`

===== Usage of JavaMail API

The `Email` component uses an external library, JavaMail to send email out from Augustine. The code snippet below sets
up (link:#SMTP[SMTP]) for email sending.

[source,java]
----
private void prepEmailProperties() {
    props = new Properties();
    props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
    props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.port", "465");
    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.class", "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory");
    props.put("mail.smtp.port", "465");
}

/**
* Sends email out using JavaMail API
*
* @param login email login account
* @param pass email login password
* @param message message to send
* @throws AuthenticationFailedException if gmail account can't be logged in
*/
private void sendingEmail(String login, String pass, ReadOnlyMessageDraft message)
        throws AuthenticationFailedException {
    final String username = login;
    final String password = pass;

    Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
        @Override
        protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
            return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password);
        }
    });

    try {
        Message newMessage = new MimeMessage(session);
        newMessage.setFrom(new InternetAddress(username));
        newMessage.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, message.getRecipientsEmails());
        newMessage.setSubject(message.getSubject());
        newMessage.setText(message.getMessage());

        Transport.send(newMessage);
    } catch (AuthenticationFailedException e) {
        throw new AuthenticationFailedException();
    } catch (MessagingException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);

 one recipient. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Select recipient email list based on last displayed contact list +

// tag::birthday[]
=== Birthday tab

The birthday tab is facilitated by the `Model`, `Logic`, and `UI` components. It allows the user to display the main
contact list sorted by birth dates. A contact whose birthday is closest to the current system time will be displayed
first. If a contact should be celebrating his birthday today, then his contact card will be highlighted in blue.

===== Implementation details

There are several components that are key to the implementation this functionality:

===== Birthdate class

Every contact is required to have a blank `-` or a valid `dd/mm/yyyy` date stored in its Birthdate field, which is
enforced through the `BIRTHDATE_VALIDATION_REGEX` String implemented in the class, failing which will cause an
`IllegalValueException` to be thrown.

===== sortBirthdate method

The `sortBirthdate` method is a method added onto `ModelManager`. It updates as the main contact list changes
and runs the following sorting algorithm on a separate `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object:

[source, java]
----
public void sortBirthdate() {

    Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {

       public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
            String birthdate1 = o1.getBirthdate().value;

            String birthdate2 = o2.getBirthdate().value;
            DateTimeFormatter format = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy");

            LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
            LocalDate date1;
            LocalDate date2;

            try {
                date1 = LocalDate.parse(birthdate1, format).withYear(today.getYear());
            } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
                date1 = LocalDate.of(9999, 12, 30);
            }

            try {
                date2 = LocalDate.parse(birthdate2, format).withYear(today.getYear());
            } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
                date2 = LocalDate.of(9999, 12, 30);
            }

            if (date1.isBefore(today)) {
                date1 = date1.withYear(date1.getYear() + 1);
            }

            if (date2.isBefore(today)) {
                date2 = date2.withYear(date2.getYear() + 1);
            }

            return date1.compareTo(date2);
            }
    };

    sortedPersonsListBirthdate.setComparator(sort);
}
----

By converting the birthdates in question to contain the same year as the current system time, we check if the updated date
is before or after today's date. If that date has already passed, increment the year by one. You could think of the
updated dates as the date of the next birthday celebration for each contact.

For example, running this algorithm in November 2017 on a contact with a birthdate of `15/02/1995` would update it
to `15/02/2018`. (only for the sorting process, the actual contact information will not be touched)

Afterwards it is simply a matter of sorting the dates normally.

<<<

===== LeftDisplayPanel class

The new `SortedList` will then be passed as a separate parameter into the `LeftDisplayPanel` constructor along the
main contact list. This new list, sorted by birthdates, will be displayed on a separate tab in the left display panel.

===== PersonCardBirthday class

Through a `setColor` method, a contact's card will be highlighted if his birthday is today (system time). This is
achieved in a similar fashion as the above birthday sort. By updating a contact's birthdate's year to that of today's
as such:

[source, java]
----
date1 = LocalDate.parse(person.getBirthdate().value, format).withYear(now.getYear());
----

we can easily compare that date with today's date. If they are equal, the contact's birthday is today, and through
the `SetStyle` method from the Java API we can easily update the colour to highlight this.

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Method for displaying the sorted birthday list#
====
**Alternative 1:** Using a command +

* **Pros:** Fewer tabs, easier to implement. +
* **Cons:** This functionality will be less intuitive. It will be unlikely for the user to input a command regularly
 just to check for upcoming birthdays. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Using a separate tab +

* **Pros:** User can check for upcoming birthdays without affecting the regular functionality of Augustine. There
 is no need for the contact list to be re-sorted every time, and the birthday tab updates in real-time. +
* **Cons:** An extra tab is harder to implement, and the constant checking of birthdates for sorting and highlighting
 might cost some performance. +
====

<<<

---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Format requirements for birthdate field#
====
**Alternative 1:** To allow any reasonable date formats such as d/mm, dd/m, dd.mm.yy , dd-mm-yyyy +

* **Pros:** Users have more control over their preferred formats. +
* **Cons:** Extremely difficult to account for the different variations and all their permutations, causing the sort
implementation to be overly complicated. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Restrict input to dd/mm/yyyy +

* **Pros:** Consistent and simpler implementation. +
* **Cons:** More restrictive, user might intuitively try to input a date like 1/12/1983 which Augustine would reject. +

=== Instagram tab

The Instagram tab is facilitated by the `Model`, `Logic`, and `UI` components. It allows the user to view a contact's
Instagram profile page. If a contact does not contain the necessary username information, the tab will redirect the user to
Instagram's home page.

===== Implementation details

The following activity diagram (Figure 28) highlights the flow of logic when the user inputs the Instagram command:


[caption="Figure 28: "]
.Activity diagram of the Instagram command
image::InstagramDiagram.png[width="813"]

There are several components that are key to the implementation this functionality:

<<<

===== UserId class

Every contact is required to have a blank `-` or a valid alphanumeric Instagram ID stored in its `UserId` field, which
is enforced through the `USERNAME_VALIDATION_REGEX` String implemented in the class, failing which will cause an
`IllegalValueException` to be thrown.

===== loadInsta method

The `loadInsta` method is a method added to the `BrowerPanel` class. When a `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is raised,
this method will be called to load the required Instagram page. Since it is ensured that a '-' will populate the `UserId`
field even if the information is not available, an `if` statement allows us to go to the Instagram home page in
the case of unavailable information.

Instagram profile page URLs are formatted as such: `https://www.instagram.com/<userId>/`, so it is a simple matter of
appending the contact's `UserId` to `https://www.instagram.com/` to load the required page.

[source, java]
----
public void loadInsta(ReadOnlyPerson person) {

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Behaviour when `UserId` is not available#
====
**Alternative 1:** Using Instagram's API to search Instagram with the contact's `Name`. +

* **Pros:** Huge benefit to user convenience since a user is not likely to have Instagram IDs of every contact. +
* **Cons:** As of recent years, Instagram has significantly restricted its API usage, we would not be able to implement this
  without going through a permissions request and Instagram's approval, which is excessive for a student project. +
====

<<<

====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Redirect to homepage +

* **Pros:** Much simpler to implement. User can still do a manual search from the homepage. +
* **Cons:** Not as convenient as Alternative 1 for the user. +

=== Backup function

The Backup function allows the user to save his existing data on a backup file.

===== Implementation details

`Model` simply raises a `BackupAddressBookEvent` when the command is executed, instead of directly asking `Storage` to
save the backup file to the hard disk. The event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the
`Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them, helping to reduce direct coupling between
components.


The diagram below shows how the various components react to this command:

== Documentation

Documentation for Augustine are done in acsiidoc.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc provides more flexibility in formatting, although it is more complex than Markdown.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the `AsciiDoc plugin` for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc`
files in real-time.

---

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to publish GitHub Pages using Travis.

---

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with -> Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot on the next page.

== Testing

Tests are a vital part in the development of Augustine as they ensure that the existing features in Augustine are working as intended.
 They also ensure that new features introduced into Augustine do not conflict with existing ones.

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests in Augustine.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

<<<

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

Open a console and run the following command:

- Windows       : `gradlew clean allTests`
- Mac/Linux     : `./gradlew clean allTests`

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library that Augustine uses, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
In headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen, allowing the developer to continue using the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the following command:

- Windows   : `gradlew clean headless allTests`
- Mac/Linux : `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests in Augustine is the 3rd method as the first two might
 fail at some interface tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

---

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests available in Augustine:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test Augustine by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components within Augustine. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ that test the lowest level methods/classes within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that test the integration of multiple code units that are assumed to be working within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests that tests multiple code units as well as how they are connected together within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

---

=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: Unable to execute gradlew commands.**

* Reason: Java path is configured wrongly, or more than one versions of Java are detected on the system.
* Solution: Uninstall all Java files and reinstall the latest `Java JDK 8` available.
If you are on *Windows*, ensure that the system environment variables are properly configured.

**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Development operations

Usage of automation and monitoring tools are a vital part of Augustine's developmental process. These tools help to reduce hiccups in
Augustine's development by ensuring that the stability of Augustine is not compromised as new features are added.

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

---

=== Continuous integration (CI)

Augustine uses both Travis and AppVeyor to perform _continuous integration_ during its developmental process.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> to learn how to use Travis and AppVeyor for CI.

---

<<<

=== Making a release

We publish a new release every time a new feature is added onto Augustine.

Here are the steps to create a new release for Augustine.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file that you created in step 2.

---

=== Managing dependencies

Augustine uses Gradle to manage its dependencies on third-party libraries. Gradle will automatically download the dependencies.
This is preferred to some other ways of managing dependencies for the following reasons:

.  Including these libraries in the repo bloats the repo size.
.  Requiring developers to download the libraries manually creates extra work for them.

[NOTE]
Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing.

<<<

== Future enhancements

Augustine is still under heavy development. This section lists various enhancements and features which are in consideration for future updates.
Each improvement is expressed as a problem to be fixed along with its possible solutions.

=== Photo

====
Problem::
Photo source needs to end with .jpg or .jpeg. As a result, photos from websites that hides file extension are unable to be used.

Solution::
We could try if we can access the link given by the user. We then download the content of the link and check if the photo is a .jpg / .jpeg file
by checking the file header of the downloaded file.
::
This will also enable a more stringent check on photos given by the user as the user may attempt to fulfill the .jpg / .jpeg requirement by changing a file's
file extension to .jpg / .jpeg.
====
'''

=== Schedule

====
Problem::
The schedule feature uses NUSmods heavily, as a result, it is only able to display NUS lessons and requires an active internet connection.

Solution::
We could render the timetable with JavaFX instead of relying on the browser to fetch NUSmods website. This will require storing module information which contains time of lessons which can be obtain from the NUSmods API in .json format.
::
This will eliminate the need to have a constant connection and open up the possibility of adding non-NUS related activities to the schedule.

====

<<<

====
Problem::
Users are able to enter non-existent module codes, lesson types and lesson slots as long as they fulfill the regular expression.

Solution::
Instead of using regular expression, we could check against module information obtained from NUSmods API.
====

'''

=== UI

====
Problem::
When there are no contacts to be listed, the area where the personListView is supposed to be will display a white box.
====

'''

=== Email

====
Problem::
Augustine stores the email login username and password as unencrypted String variables which is insecure.
====

====
Problem::
Augustine is considered as an insecure application. Hence, “allow less secure apps to log in” must be enabled in the Gmail settings in order to send an email.
====

====
Problem::
Augustine only allows text email message to be send. Attachment email is not integrated into Augustine.
====

<<<
'''

=== Instagram tab

====
Problem::
When username information is unavailable, Augustine redirects the user to Instagram's homepage

Solution::
If we can obtain Instagram's permission to use their API in the future, we could do a search using the contact's real name
even when their Instagram username is unavailable.
