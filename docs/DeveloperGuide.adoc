== Introduction

Welcome to MedNus! MedNus is a contacts application for busy doctors.
It is designed to be completely operable without the user taking their hands off
their keyboard. This developer guide tells new developers how the project is
structured, and contains a summary of component API calls for experienced
developers.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK] `1.8.0_60`* or later
. *https://www.jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ]* IDE
. Enable the *Gradle and JavaFx plugins* (installed by default)

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it.
. Click `Open as Project`, accepting the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`).
. This generates all resources required by the application and tests. It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message.
. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try some commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Necessary configurations before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards] instead of IntelliJ's default style (particularly for import statement ordering).

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. And then go to `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
    Figure 1: The Architecture Diagram below explains the high-level design of the App.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` is written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]). It is used for communication amongst components in an event-driven manner.
* `LogsCenter` is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components with longer write-ups in the following sections. Here is a summary:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] is the UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] is the command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Keep in mind that each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 2: UML diagram of the UI Component showing how it is structured

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 3: Structure of the Logic Component

Note the `XYZCommand` class on the right of the diagram. Its structure is detailde in the next figure.

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 4: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Events-driven nature of the design

    Figure 5: Interactions *between components* for a `delete 1` command


image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
    Figure 6: Interactions *within the Logic Component* for the `delete 1` Command


=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 7: Structure of the Model Component

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores MedNus data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 8: Structure of the Storage Component

The `Storage` component:

* Can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Can save MedNus data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of MedNus (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 9: Logic Command Class Diagram

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of MedNus before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in MedNus. The current state of MedNus is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 10: Undo Redo Starting Stack Diagram

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.


image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 11: Undo Redo New Command Stack Diagram

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore MedNus to the state before the `add` command executed.


image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 12: Execute Undo Stack Diagram

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:


image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 13: Undo Redo Sequence Diagram

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores MedNus to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).


image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 14: Undo Redo New Command Stack Diagram 2

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:


image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 15: Undo Redo New Command Stack Diagram 3

The following activity diagram summarises what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:


image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
    Figure 16: Undo Redo Activity Diagram

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire MedNus. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** How redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the undoable command and executes it again. +
**Pros:** Will use memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the command and executes it again). +
**Cons:** If the list view changes, the undo command may not be applicable anymore.
See section 4.1.2 for more details. +
**Alternative 2:** Saves the entire MedNus. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** May have memory issues.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies MedNus (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of MedNus and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]


==== Redo Limitation

As of v1.5, there is a limitation with the redo function. If the list changes before the command is redone, the saved undo
command may not be applicable to the new list. +

*Commands to replicate limitation*

Inputs:

1. `list` (List all)
2. `find david` (Assume this command is valid and only 1 such person exist in the list)
3. `delete 1` (Deletes david)
4. `undo` (Undo deletion)
5. `list` (List all)
6. `redo` (Redo deletion of david)

Expected output:  David is deleted from the list. +
Actual output: Alex is delete from the list. As Alex is index 1 in the list, he is deleted instead. +

Due to this limitation, users are warned in the user guide to redo commands before changing view.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::bloodtype[]
=== *Enhancement: Bloodtype* +

*Reason for implementation* +

As MedNus is designed for doctors to use, being able to record the blood types of patients will be a helpful +
feature for them. There are many times that doctors need to know what blood type their patients have for medical +
reasons; cases where blood transfusion is required for patients are of utmost importance to prevent a patient +
from receiving a incompatible blood type.

*How it is implemented* +

A Bloodtype class is created with one constructor. +

....
new Bloodtype("AB+")
....

The constructor requires a string input that accepts only 12 inputs that are case insentive. +
Valid inputs are: A, A+, A-, B, B+, B-, O, O+, O-, AB, AB+, AB-. +

As of version 1.1, Person constructor includes Bloodtype.

....
new Person(name, phone, email, address, bloodType, tags, remark);
....

*Reasons for how it is implemented*

The reason that there is a one to three character limit as blood types are one character input at minimum (e.g "A") +
and three characters input, inclusive of "+" or "-", at maximum (e.g "AB-"). +

The reason that ascii is used as the regex is to allowed "+" and "-" to be entered as inputs to take into account +
the Rh factor of blood types.
// end::bloodtype[]

=== *Enhancement: Set Appointments* +

*Reason for implementation* +
// tag::appointmentjustification[]
MedNus is designed for doctors to use. Doctors often have fixed appointments with patients and the list
maybe very long. This implementation allows doctors to set an appointment date with a patient. +
On top of just setting appointment time, the user can also sort the contacts by appointment timing. This is so that the
doctor will be remind of their most upcoming appointment in the midst of their busy schedule. +
// end::appointmentjustification[]

*How it is implemented* +
// tag::appointmentimplementation[]

As of version 1.5, each person now has a class AppointmentList under himself.

image::personclassdiagram.png[width="300"]
    Figure 17: Person class diagram with appointments

The AppointmentList class holds an internal list that holds the Appointment class. +
Appointments are made up of 3 internal variables.

** Description: Holds a string about the appointment. Used for identifying the appointment.
** Start Date: Holds the starting time of the appointment. Used for sorting appointments and UI.
** End Date: Holds the end time of the appointment. Used for UI.


*Adding/Canceling appointments* +

Defensive programming is implemented for appointment adding/canceling.

When there is a call to the model to add/cancel an appointment to a person,
the AppointmentList returns a mutable copy of the appointment list to the caller and this list is
changed-insulated against the internal list.

  public List<Appointment> toList() { return new ArrayList<>(internalList); }

This ensures that no methods can directly change the internal list. The only way to update the list is to
create a new appointmentList through the person and passing the new List<Appointment> through the constructor.

    public void setAppointment(List<Appointment> appointments) {
        this.appointments.set(new AppointmentList(appointments));
      }

To illustrate the process of adding an appointment, a sequence diagram is provided below.

image::SDforAppointment.png[width=""]
    Figure 18: Person class diagram with appointments

As seen from the diagram, the original appointment list is untouched. The method call causes a new appointment list
to be made which is a copy of the original list and the addition of the new appointment. This ensures that the
internal list is untouched.


// end::appointmentimplementation[]

//

=== *Enhancement: Set tag color*


*Reason for implementation* +
// tag::colorjustification[]

We would like our users to be able to set a unique tag to any color that they want either by specifying the color or
using RBG numbers. This allows users more freedom in choice of color of tags, as they may want to make some tags more
glaring in color.
// end::colorjustification[]

*How it is implemented* +
// tag::colorimplementation[]

Each unique tag will have its color as its attribute as a string.

In the UI component, the tag is set by using the css attribute of the tag label.

             tagLabel.setStyle("-fx-background-color: " + tag.getTagColor());

To illustrate how tag colors are set, below is a sequence diagram for how the random tag color command is executed.

image::SDforTagColor.png[width="800"]
    Figure 19: Sequence diagram for random tag color Model Component

The sequence diagram is given if the command requests the model to set all the tags to a random color. As seen from
above diagram, each tag is updated to a certain color and does not need to know which tag belongs to which person.

// end::colorimplementation[]

=== *Enhancement: List Package* +
// tag::list[]
*Reason for implementation* +

This enhancement taps on the concept of Open-closed principle, enhancing the listing capabilities of the `list` command +

We provide our users with five main listing functionality +

[width="59%",cols="22%,<70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Functionality |Reason for implementation

|Basic Listing |Existing Implementation

|List by tags |Contacts in MedNus have various tags. +
Be it family, patients or colleagues, users can now sort their contacts based on such tags.

|List alphabetically by name (Ascending) |Organises MedNus. +
 +
Easier for users to browse through contacts in situations where `find` command cannot be used. +
 +
Scenarios include - +
1. Spring cleaning MedNus +
2. Comparing displayed list with another list - Would be user unfriendly to use the `find` command for every line compared.

|List alphabetically by name (Descending) | 1. Similar reason for List alphabetically by name (Ascending) +
2. Instead of having user to type `list asc` followed by `list reverse`, we minimize user input by creating the `list dsc` command.

|Reverse the displayed list |1. Any new contacts added are appended to the end of the list. List reversal allows user to look at newly appended contacts without having to scroll all the way down. +
2. We reverse the list instead of appending newly added contacts to the top of the list as older patients should be given more attention and thus, be at the top of the list.

|=======================================================================
// end::list[]

// tag::listImplementation[]
*How it is implemented* +

Figure 20 as follows shows the activity diagram for the list package. +
Implementation passes through two main segements: Logic and Model. +

image::ListPackageActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 20: List Package Activity Diagram

An explanation will be provided using ListByTag Command as an example. +
The sequence diagram of the ListByTag Command can be seen in Figure 21 as follows. +

image::ListByTagSD.png[width="800"]
    Figure 21: ListByTag Command Sequence Diagram

The explanation for the above diagram is as follows: +

1. Logic

* AddressBookParser: Detects if list keyword contains keyword after +
e.g. friends or family
* ListByTagParser:
** Parses the input by splitting the string of tags that come after the list keyword +
Parsed string : friends or family
** Forms a predicate based on the parsed tags
** Creates a ListByTagCommand class and passes the predicate as an argument
* ListByTagCommand:
** Sets the predicate locally
** Runs the execution which calls the model segment for filtering using the set predicate

2. Model

* Updates the filter of the filtered person list to filter by the given predicate +
e.g. Predicate with the parsed string above filters all persons in MedNus +
that has the tag "friends" or "family"
* Saves the filtered list in the memory
* Outputs the filtered list onto the result display screen of the application

*Reason for how it is implemented*

The newly added list enhancements build on and make use of existing implementations +

* Building on existing implementations +
Instead of recreating the list feature, extra list commands are created +
so that developers can easily pinpoint the cause of the error in the unlikely event that one surfaces.

* Makes use of existing implementations +
Instead of thinking of new algorithms, the command uses existing implementations such as +
filtering of contacts and parsing of text inputs to reduce errors and complexity.

*Future enhancements*

Potential enhancements include the use of complex search algorithms such as google's search algorithms +
to provide users with the ability to search for users with greater detail. However, this is something +
unlikely to have and will ensue only once all existing must-have and good-to-have are completed.

// end::listImplementation[]

=== *Enhancement: Command Box Keyboard Shortcuts* +

// tag::shortcutreason[]
*Reason for implementation* +

Such a feature is implemented to enhance the experience of users and allows developers to debug +
newly implemented features with greater ease that requires the use of the command input text box. +

The feature allows users and developers to easily navigate and edit input text.

// end::shortcutreason[]

// tag::shortcutimple[]
*How it is implemented* +

There are three key improvements that the enhancement brings

1. Navigation

* Shifting cursor all the way to the
** Start using SHIFT-ALT +
by setting the caret position to 0
** End using SHIFT-CONTROL +
by setting the caret position to the length of the input text which brings +
the caret all the way to the right.

* Shifting cursor by chunks (word/empty spaces) +
in the scenario where the user does not want to travel all the way to the end but also +
does not want to manually shift right by 1 cursor space every time.
** Shift Left using ALT +
by first checking if a black space or character is on the left and shifting until +
a character or blank space is found respectively
** Shift Right using CONTROL +
by first checking if a black space or character is on the right and shifting until +
a character or blank space is found respectively

2. Deletion

* Deleting all text by pressing the ESCAPE key +
which resets the input text field in the commandTextField

* Deletes by chunk (word/blank space) +
for users who do not want to delete the entire text input and do not want to manually delete +
character by character. +
** Chunks are deleted by covering all possible text deletion combination of characters and blank space, +
using the following order as check formula +
1.Checks if caret is at the start of text +
2.Checks if caret is at the end of text +
3.Checks for empty space before +
4.Checks if caret is between characters +
5.Else, assumes that blank space is present on the right and character is present on the left.


3. Usage of Add Command +
* Purpose: As the text required to create a contact can be long with all the required prefixes, +
this shortcut eliminates the need for users to memorize the order in which the prefixes are needed +
and eliminates the need to remember what prefixes are needed even if in random order.

* Logic: +
+
First, check if caret is at the end of the text +
+
Secondly, check if valid add command keyword is present at the start of the text +
+
Next, checks which prefix is missing from the text needed to create the person and adds on to the existing text +
based on the priority of : name, phone, email, address, bloodtype and tag. +
+
If all necessary prefixes are present, subsequent concatenation will be that of the tag prefix.


*Reason for how it is implemented*

* Using of Shift-Key +
Shift key is needed to minimize the number of keys used. +
+
Firstly, if a certain function such as left navigation is tagged to ALT, an association is formed and it will be easy for users to remember +
+
Secondly, we want to avoid using the alphabet keys and other important keys which may already possess usable functionalities.

* Brute Force +
Many of the commands are done by doing a brute force checking of all possible combinations +
though not ideal, it is workable as there is only a limited number of combinations not exceeding 5. +
+
Brute force is used to eliminate the need to throw exceptions which can never be called which in turn +
adversely affect test coverage as these exception can never be thrown.

// end::shortcutimple[]

*Future enhancements*

* Add Command Shortcut: As of now, Prefixes are hard-coded to reflect existing available prefixes +
+
Potential enhancements involves syncing the shortcut to the CliSyntax.java file to obtain the necessary +
prefixes

=== *Enhancement: Remark Command* +

// tag::remarkreason[]
*Reason for implementation* +

This feature allows users to take down and save any additional information regarding their patients. +
Being able to save a remark field, unique to the contact, is crucial in cases where there is no allocated +
user field for the additonal information.

// end::remarkreason[]

// tag::remarkimple[]

*How it is implemented* +
Implementation passes through two main segments: Logic and Model. +

The sequence diagram of the Remark Command can be seen in Figure 22 below. +

image::RemarkSD.png[width="800"]
    Figure 22: Remark Command Sequence Diagram

The explanation for the above diagram is as follows: +

1. Logic
* AddressBookParser: Detects if remark keyword contains keyword after +
e.g. 1 r/Allergic to Pollen
* RemarkCommandParser:
** Parses the input by extracting the text that come after the prefix +
and extracts the input index +
Parsed index : 1 +
Parsed string : Allergic to Pollen
** Creates a RemarkCommand class and passes the index and string as arguments
* RemarkCommand:
** Sets the index and remark locally
** Runs the execution which calls the model

2. Model

* 1. Calls the model and gets the filtered persons list
* 2. Creates a new Person object with the local remark variable instantiated
* 3. Updates the filtered persons list
* 4. Gets the updated filtered persons list

*Reason for how it is implemented* +

* Makes use of existing implementations +
Instead of thinking of new algorithms, the command uses existing implementations such as +
filtering of contacts and parsing of text inputs to reduce errors and complexity.


*Future enhancements* +

Remark fields exceeding a certain word count will not be able to fully display on the display screen. +
 +
Potential enhancements involves saving the data in a tab on the display screen which will pop up +
upon clicking, displaying the remark attached to the contact. However, this is something +
unlikely to have and will ensue only once all existing must-have and good-to-have are completed.

Since MedNus has Bloodtype implemented, we decided that being able to list people according to blood types +
is going to be helpful for doctors. There are going to be times where hospitals run out of blood for blood transfusion +
and related medical procedures. Being able to find patients quicklywith compatible blood types is going to be critical +
in these types of emergencies.

*How it is implemented* +


image::SDforListByBloodtypeCommandLogic.png[width="800"]
    Figure 23: ListByBloodyTypeCommand Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram for ListByBloodtypeCommand class within the Logic Component is as shown above.

A ListByBloodtypeCommand class is created with one constructor with input from ListByBloodtypeCommandParser. +

....
new ListByBloodtypeCommand(new BloodtypeContainsKeywordPredicate("A"));
....

A ListByBloodtypeCommandParser is created with one constructor.

....
new ListByBloodtypeCommandParser("A");
....

The first constructor takes the input from ListByBloodtypeParser and compares blood types with people listed in +
MedNus through BloodtypeContainsKeywordPredicate. +

The second constructor takes in a String from the user.

*Reasons for how it is implemented*

The reason for the use of ListByBloodtypeCommandParser is to filter out extra spaces that the user may have typed in.

// end::listbloodtype[]

// tag::batch[]
=== *Enhancement: Batch delete all persons who share a particular tag* +

MedNus is designed for power users. Thus, batch deletions are a welcome addition since they make it less tedious to perform deletions on multiple patients, and instead delete batches as identified by a tag. +
*Format:* `batch TAG` +
*Shorthand format:* `b TAG` +

Since v1.5rc, batch deletion now accepts multiple arguments. In other words, the format is now: +
*Format:* `batch TAG TAG TAG...` +
*Shorthand format:* `b TAG TAG...` +

*How it is implemented* +

In view of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle[open / closed principle],
the Command class is open to extension but closed to modification. Its source code need not be edited for its behaviour to be extended in another object.
Thus, to implement the batch deletion feature, a new `BatchCommand` class is extended from the Command class. +

In short, `BatchCommand` passes a set of tags to the Model Component which handles the actual deletions. Here's the constructor for the BatchCommand class. +

 BatchCommand(Set<Tag> tagsToDelete)

The sequence diagram for using this Command class within the Logic Component is given below. +


image::SDforBatchDeleteLogic.png[width="800"]
    Figure 24: Sequence diagram for a batch myTags command in the Logic component

The model component will handle the actual deletion operations. To support this, an additional method is defined in the Model interface for implementation by the ModelManager class. +

 void deletePersonsByTags(Set<Tag> tags)

See the sequence diagram below to better understand the full range of interactions involved. +

image::SDforBatchDeleteModel.png[width="800"]
    Figure 25: Sequence diagram for a batch myTag command in the Model component

*Reasons for how it is implemented*

One thing you'll notice is that coupling between the logic and model component is minimised into the sole function call +

 deletePersonsByTags(Set<Tag> tags)

Indeed, tracing the sequence diagrams will show you that each interaction is essentially a similar instruction.
The seemingly unnecessary and roudabout sequence of function calls was actually conceived in view of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter[Law of Demeter].
Objects ought not to "talk to strangers", or in other words, interact with objects more than one degree of separation away from them.
This is justification for the "bureaucracy" between objects in the components.

*Future enhancements*

We would like to include more batch operations beyond deletion. For example, editing tags, remarks, and other contact attributes by batch.
A general function call between the logic and model components ought to be created. This could serve all batch operations (e.g. batch edit, batch tagging, etc.), depending on its arguments. +

If you would like to implement such a feature, please do so by adding additional parameters to the BatchCommand as such: +

 BatchCommand(TypeOfBatchCommand type, Set<Tag> tagsToDelete)

This is for reasons of complying with a Facade design pattern which is used throughout MedNus - where BatchCommand is the facade.
This is important particularly in cases where we want to retain polymorphism (of the BatchCommand class) and support the Open-Closed principle. +

// end::batch[]

// tag::dups[]
=== *Enhancement: Display potential duplicate contacts* +

Doctors can occasionally clean up their contacts in case duplicates have accumulated over time. The `duplicates` command compiles a list of potential duplicate contacts for the user to review.
*Format:* `duplicates` +
*Shorthand format:* `dups` +

*How it is implemented* +

In view of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle[open / closed principle],
the Command class is open to extension but closed to modification. Its source code need not be edited for its behaviour to be extended in another object.
Thus, to implement the batch deletion feature, a new `DuplicatesCommand` class is extended from the Command class. +

Its constructor is given as +

 DuplicatesCommand()

See the sequence diagram below to better understand the interactions within the Logic component. +

image::SDforDuplicatesLogic.png[width="800"]
    Figure 26: Sequence diagram for a duplicates command in the Logic component

See the sequence diagram below to better understand the interactions it triggers within the Model component. +

image::SDforDuplicatesModel.png[width="800"]
    Figure 27: Sequence diagram within the Model component resulting from a duplicates command

As you've noticed in the diagram, a new `Predicate` is defined as

 HasPotentialDuplicatesPredicate(ArrayList<Name> duplicateNames)

This predicate is compared against persons in MedNus, so as to generate a list of potential duplicate persons.
At the moment, persons are considered potential duplicates if they share the same name (case-insensitive) with any other person in MedNus.

*Future enhancements*

We would like to include a sync feature with a user's online accounts (e.g. Facebook, iCloud) that could increase the ability of MedNus to resolve duplicates on the user's behalf.
If you would like to implement such a feature, please contact the core team before starting out. We would like to know in advance how such an enhancement would impact the architecture of MedNus. +

// end::dups[]

// tag::copy[]
=== *Enhancement: Copy contact's email address to clipboard* +

Embracing the keyboard-centric interaction of MedNus,
even copying data into the user's clipboard is possible using purely keyboard commands.
The Copy command lets users do just that. +
*Format:* `copy INDEX` +
*Shorthand format:* `c INDEX` +

*How it is implemented* +

In view of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle[open / closed principle],
the Command class is open to extension but closed to modification. Its source code need not be edited for its behaviour to be extended in another object.
Thus, to implement the copy-to-clipboard feature, a new `CopyCommand` class is extended from the Command class. +

Its constructor is given as +

 CopyCommand(Index targetIndex)

See the sequence diagram below to better understand the interactions within the Logic component. +

image::SDCopyCommandLogic.png[width="800"]
    Figure 28: Sequence diagram for a Copy command in the Logic component

As you've might have noticed in the diagram, two foreign-looking classes are used – namely, `Clipboard` and `ClipboardContent`.
These classes represent how MedNus interacts with the actual system clipboard. Check out the
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/input/Clipboard.html[Clipboard class API] and
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/input/ClipboardContent.html[ClipboardContent class API] for
a clear idea of how they work. +

*Future enhancements*

Currently, MedNus only allows copying of contact email addresses into the system clipboard.
In the future, we would like doctors to have the ability to copy other information – e.g. addresses, medical tags, remarks etc. +

If you would like to contribute to such additional functionality, please edit the CopyCommand class to take in additional parameters
corresponding to the new function e.g. +

 CopyCommand(NewFunction newFunction, Index targetIndex)

This is for reasons of complying with a Facade design pattern (where CopyCommand is the facade) which is used throughout MedNus.
This is important particularly in cases where we want to retain polymorphism (of the CopyCommand class) and support the Open-Closed principle. +
// end::copy[]

// tag::relationship[]

=== *Enhancement: Relationship Command* +

*Reason for implementation* +

As MedNus is designed for doctors to use, being able to check the relationships of a patient +
is very useful especially in emergency situation when contacting a patient's family and friends +
are of utmost importance.

*How it is implemented* +
The immplementation involves two main segments Logic and Model. +

The sequence diagram of the Relationship Command is shown in Figure 29 below. +

image::SDforRelationshipCommand.png[width="800"]
    Figure 29: Sequence Diagram for Relationship Command

* Firstly, the AddressBookParser checks if there is anything after `relation`. +
e.g 1 rel/Husband: John Doe
* Secondly, the RemarkCommandParser parses the input `1 rel/Husband: John Doe`. +
Parsed index: 1 +
Parsed string: Husband: John Doe
* Thirdly, a RelationshipCommand is created and the parsed index and string are passed as arguments. +
The index and relationship is set locally and execution, which calls the model, is run.
* Next, model is called and filtered persons list is gotten. +
A new Person object is created with local relationship variable instantiated. +
The filtered persons list is updated. +
Model gets the updated filtered persons list.

*Reason for how it is implemented* +

The relationship command makes use of existing implementations to reduce potential bugs that +
might surfaced when an entirely new code is added to the existing code.

// end::relationship[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

There are three ways to run tests. Method 3 is the most reliable, given how GUI tests may fail becaues of platform / resolution-specific idiosyncracies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

MedNus depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Troubleshooting
. Despite compiling, MedNus doesn’t open
.. Reopen MedNus
.. If issue persists, redo the setup by following the instructions in 1.2.

*Contacts*

Author: Apple Inc.

Pros:

* Display of information is neat, well-organised, visually pleasing
* Supports automatic groupings of contacts (e.g. same surname)
* Supports import and export of contacts in popular file formats

Cons:

* Lacks command-line (or keyboard-only) interface for power users
* Animations are unnecessarily slow
* Navigating through multiple data input fields per contact is very tedious
