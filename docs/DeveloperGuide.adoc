By: `Team CS2103 AUG-2017 B3`      Since: `Aug 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent` that can
be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::eventcrud[]
=== Events CRUD Mechanism
The events CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) mechanism is very similar to the persons CRUD system.  Four commands
`AddEventCommand`, `FindEventCommand` (work in progress), `DeleteEventCommand`, `EditEventCommand` are used to execute their respective
functions through the `LogicManager`. +

image::EventsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands are first read from `CommandBox` in the UI Component which then calls upon the `LogicManager` in the Logic Component
to detect the type of command.
`LogicManager` then creates a `AddressBookParser` which uses `CheckCommandsParser` to detect any synonymous alternatives
for their respective commands and returns the specific command type if available. +

The specific command type is passed through its specific parser along with its arguments (E.g. `DeleteEventCommand` is parsed
via `DeleteEventCommandParser`). The specific parser creates a specific command to return to `LogicManager` (E.g.
`DeleteEventCommandParser` returns `DeleteEventCommand` with the index of the `Event` to be be deleted once executed). +

`LogicManager` proceeds to execute the received command. In this implementation, the Command will call upon
`ModelManager` in the Model component to do complete the respective CRUD operation onto its internal database.
(E.g. `DeleteEventCommand` results in `model.deleteEvent(event)` to delete the event at index indicated by
`DeleteEventCommandParser` from the event list in `AddressBook`. +

Once the model component has been updated, a signal is sent to the the `filteredEventList` which updates the UI
Component. +

Additionally, an `AddressBookChangedEvent` is also raised to the `EventsCenter` to indicate a change into so that
`XmlAddressBookStorage` in the storage component can begin saving the new information. It calls on
`XmlSerializableAddressBook` to serialize the new event list information and saves it to the data file via
`XmlFileStorage`.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect 1:** Implementation of Storage +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saving to a single XML file shared with contact data +
****
**Pros:**

* We do not need a separate data file to save event information. Additionally, reading data is only done once. +

**Cons:**

* Not very modular and intuitive. +

****

**Alternative 2:** Create a separate XML file to record events data +
****
**Pros:**

* Modular and intuitive to new developers. Manual additions to the data file will also be easier. +

**Cons:**

* Separate files are harder to manage.
****

**Aspect 2:** Implementation of Parsers +

**Alternative 1 (current choice): ** Creating individual parsers for a new function (E.g. `AddEventCommandParser` for `AddEventCommand`) +
****
**Pros:**

* Modular implementation where a parser only parses for a specific command.

* Issues will be easy to isolate and target.

**Cons**

* Repeated functionality with correponding parsers for Persons.

****

**Alternative 2: ** Creating a shared parser for events and persons which switch functionality depending on an input +
****
**Pros:**

* Removes the repeated functionality amongst the 4 pairs of parsers.

**Cons**

* Complex implementation which will be harder to maintain in the long run of development.

* More difficulty in debugging with newer changes.

****

---
// end::eventcrud[]

// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetable Events
The timetable events schedule functions similarly to the events list on the left of the application. Upon starting the
application, after the model component initialises saved data to create its "memory-model" of the storage, `AddressBook`
uses its new functionality `getCurrentDate()` to retrieve today's date as indicated on the local machine and saves it
to retrieve the scheduled events for today. +

The implementation of the `EventList` used to store all the events in the model component has been modified to a `TreeMap`
to allow the retrieval of a sublist of events between any two dates. This is done through `getObservablesSublist()` which
uses the current date and the date that is one day after (possible due to the implementation of `addDays()` in `Date`. +

image::TimetableUpdate.png[width="800"]

This list is stored in the model component and will be updated accordingly if there are any changes to events made known
upon the signalling of `AddressBookChangedEvent`.

// end::timetable[]

// tag::scheduling[]
=== Event Scheduling

Whenever an event is created, it will be added into an
`ObservableTreeMap` of events, ranked by the scheduled date and time. This
will enable us to implement the event scheduling feature comprised of two
essential sub-features：

* A GUI displaying all the events scheduled
* A drag-and-drop action listener for quick and convenient rescheduling of
events

==== Event Scheduling

When a `CheckSchedule` command is typed into the command box, or when the
`Calendar` button on the main window is clicked, a
`ShowCalendarEvent` will be sent to the EventsCenter. In response, a calendar
GUI will appear in the main window, and events with a scheduled timing
within the current week will be extracted from the eventList and
reflected in the corresponding time slots on the calendar GUI. Each event is
a draggable pane with event titles indicated.

==== Reschedule event through drag-and-drop

When the calendar view is loaded, all the time slots will be registered for
dropping action. When the event panes are loaded, they will be registered for
dragging action. When a user drag an event and drop to a specific time slot,
the 'old' event will be removed and a 'new' event will be added at the
dropped time slot, with the sames duration. If there is a time clash between
the 'new' event and an existing event, or if the 'new' event's timing
exceeds pre-set constraints (eg. extends out of the 24-hour period) the
'dropping' action cannot be completed.

image::dndSequenceDiagrams.png[width="800"]

==== Avoid time clash

When a new event is added to the TreeMap, if the `timing` of the event has
any overlap with an existing event, this will generate a
`EventTimeClashException` that prevents the event from being added.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Date structure implementation of saved events +
**Alternative 1:** use `ObservableList` +
****
**Pros:**

* Easy to implement with default FXCollection observableList
* Easy to iterate and access individual element +

**Cons:**  +

* Will be very slow for sorting and searching for urgent events. +
****

**Alternative 2:** use a `PriorityQueue` +
****
**Pros:**

* Able to retrieve and remove the most urgent events in O(1) time +

**Cons:**

* Troublesome to update event's timeslot information
* Does not automatically sort the events in chronological order
****
**Alternative 3 (current choice):** use a customised `ObservableTreeMap` +
****
**Pros:**

* Easy to retrieve, update and remove, all in O(logN) time +
* Automatically sort events in chronological order +

**Cons:**

* Need to implement own custmised `ObservableTreeMap` as the existing
`ObservableMap` only supports `HashMap`.
****

// end::scheduling[]

// tag::repeat[]
=== Schedule Recurring Event

Recurring event can be scheduled using either the `repeat` command or by
specifying the `p/` field in eventedit. As shown in the diagram
below, the command will then edit the existing event with the
specified `repeat period`. When the new event is added, a TimerTask is
triggered, which will schedule a task to add a new event to AddressBook
immediately after this event finishes in the future. In this way, we can have
 infinitely recurring events as long as a new event can be added.

image::repeatEventSequenceDiagrams.png[width=800]

// end::repeat[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::optionalfields[]
=== Adding optional fields: Company, Position, Status, Priority, and Note

When adding a new person, the basic fields `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, and `Address` (not including `Tags`) are compulsory fields as they apply to everyone. However, for extended sales functionality, we have included additional optional fields, namely `Company`, `Position`, `Status`, `Priority`, and `Note`.

These fields are not necessarily applicable to everyone, as persons in a non-business context do not need to have these information included. Hence when adding a person, any number of these fields can be excluded and the person will still be able to be added.

The primary logic that deals with these optional fields appears in the `parse` function of the `AddCommandParser` class:
[source,java]
----
if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_ADDRESS, PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_EMAIL)) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}

try {
    Name name = ParserUtil.parseName(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME)).get();
    Phone phone = ParserUtil.parsePhone(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PHONE)).get();
    Email email = ParserUtil.parseEmail(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_EMAIL)).get();
    Address address = ParserUtil.parseAddress(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS)).get();
    //Initialize company, position, status, and note to NIL, priority to L
    Company company = new Company("NIL");
    Position position = new Position("NIL");
    Status status = new Status("NIL");
    Priority priority = new Priority("L");
    Note note = new Note("NIL");

    Set<Tag> tagList = ParserUtil.parseTags(argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_TAG));

    //Since Company, Position, Status and Priority are optional parameters, set them if they are present
    if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_COMPANY)) {
        company = ParserUtil.parseCompany(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_COMPANY)).get();
    }

    if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_POSITION)) {
        position = ParserUtil.parsePosition(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_POSITION)).get();
    }

    if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_STATUS)) {
        status = ParserUtil.parseStatus(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_STATUS)).get();
    }

    if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_PRIORITY)) {
        priority = ParserUtil.parsePriority(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PRIORITY)).get();
    }

    if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NOTE)) {
        note = ParserUtil.parseNote(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NOTE)).get();
    }

    ReadOnlyPerson person = new Person(name, phone, email, address, company, position, status, priority,
            note, tagList);
----
The 4 required fields are checked to see if they are present. If any of them are missing, a `ParseException` is thrown and the add command is invalid.

The 5 optional fields are handled differently. They are first initialized to a placeholder value ("NIL" for Company, Position, Status and Note, "L" for Priority, indicating the lowest priority). Each field is then checked to see if it has been entered in the user command through its prefix. If it has, the placeholder value is replaced by the entered string. This way, the user is able to selectively enter any of these fields (or none at all) and the `ReadOnlyPerson` object created will still have all fields initialized properly.

==== Design Considerations:
*Aspect*: Implementation of Company, Position, Status, Priority, and Note

*Alternative 1*: Make these fields compulsory like Name, Address, Phone and Email

*Pros*: Code and tests can be easily duplicated from existing fields.

*Cons*: User may not always need to enter these fields and will become burdensome.

*Alternative 2 (current choice)*: Make these fields optional

*Pros*: Users have flexibility to omit any fields they do not think is necessary. Current tests do not have to be
completely changed, instead can be extended to include additional fields.

*Cons*: New logic required to handle fields that may not be input by the user.

// tag::autoupdate[]
=== Automatic update of Person card and Person panel details when edits are made
The Person cards and Person panel are automatically updated when the user makes any edits to the fields. This is done
by registering the PersonCard and PersonPanel classes as event handlers, and subscribing to the AddressBookChangedEvent
that the EventsCenter sends out when the address book is altered. The Person card has an additional feature
of changing the colour of the priority tag depending on what the priority is. The described behaviour is illustrated in
the sequence diagram below:

image::AutoUpdateSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

==== Design Considerations:
*Aspect*: Implementation of binding card and panel fields to fields

*Alternative 1*: Bind variables to listen for observables

*Pros*: Person card fields already use this method, code can be easily duplicated.

*Cons*: Priority field will not change colour just by changing the text value. Also, Person panel will need to
change the person its variables are listening to every time a different selection is made.

*Alternative 2 (current choice)*: Register PersonCard and PersonPanel as event handlers and subscribe to
AddressBookChangedEvent

*Pros*: Priority field can change colour this way, by setting the JavaFX id of the pane the priority label is in to
different values and hence different CSS settings. Person panel will also be able to reuse the code for
handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent() as they both require the reloading of person details

*Cons*: Computationally more expensive as the functions will be called whenever the address book is changed, even if
the change does not affect that particular panel or card.
// end::autoupdate[]

// tag::photo[]
=== Attaching photo to a contact

Another optional field that can be added to a contact is the photo field. It
can be added in two ways:

* Through GUI
** When the `updatephoto` command is executed, or when the `import photo`
button on the person panel (beneath the person's photo) is clicked, a
`FileChooser` window will be opened in the main UI.
** After user has chosen the image file (restricted to jpg/jpeg/png format),
the file path will be passed into a new EditCommand `edit [index]
ph/[filepath]` which will then be processed by the `Logic` component. After
parsing, the command will be executed, and `Model` component will make the
corresponding change (updating the `Photo` field of the person with ). The
change will then be reflected in UI through an `AddressBookChangedEvent`. The
 process can be illustrated with the following sequence diagram.

image::photoGUISequenceDiagrams.png[width="1000"]

* By specifying through the `add` or `edit` command

When using CLI, the image file to be imported as the photo can be specified
with the `ph/` field in edit/add commands. After the command is successfully
parsed, the process will be similar to the sequence diagram shown above.

//tag::photo[]

// tag::Sorting[]
=== Sorting of persons list

The sorting mechanism is achieved by creating a new `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser`. It is also facilitated by
`UniquePersonList`, which resides in `AddressBook`. It supports
 the rearrangement of the person list which modifies the current arrangement. This command inherits the
`UndoableCommand` which allows the user to undo/redo the sorting.

The implementation of the `SortCommand` is as follows:

[source, java]
----
public SortCommand(String sortType) {
        this.sortType = sortType;
    }
----

As you can see from the implementation, the command requires the input to be passed as a *String* parameter. Before
the new instance of `SortCommand` is being created, the `SortCommandParser` will ensure that the input is not an
empty string.

The execution of the command is done in the following method:

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    try {
        model.sortPersonList(sortType);
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS + sortType);
    } catch (InvalidSortTypeException iste) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_UNKNOWN_SORT_TYPE);
        }
    }
----

After a series of method calls, the *model.sortPersonList()* will eventually call the *sortPerson()* method in
`UniquePersonList`.


The implementation of the *sortPerson()* method:

[source, java]
----
public void sortPerson(String type) throws InvalidSortTypeException {
    final Comparator<Person> sortByName = (Person a, Person b) -> a.getName().toString()
        .compareToIgnoreCase(b.getName().toString())
    final Comparator<Person> sortByTags = (Person a, Person b) -> a.getTags().toString()
        .compareToIgnoreCase((b.getTags().toString()));
    final Comparator<Person> sortByCompany = (Person a, Person b) -> b.getCompany().compareTo(a
        .getCompany());
    final Comparator<Person> sortByPriority = (Person a, Person b) -> a.getPriority()
        .compareTo(b.getPriority());
    final Comparator<Person> sortByPosition = (Person a, Person b) -> b.getPosition().compareTo(a
        .getPosition());
    switch (type) {
    case "name":
        internalList.sort(sortByName);
        break;
    case "tag":
        internalList.sort(sortByTags.thenComparing(sortByName));
        break;
    case "company":
        internalList.sort(sortByCompany.thenComparing(sortByName));
        break;
    case "priority":
        internalList.sort(sortByPriority.thenComparing(sortByName));
        break;
    case "position":
        internalList.sort(sortByPosition.thenComparing(sortByName));
        break;
    default:
        throw new InvalidSortTypeException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, SortCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
----
As you can see from the above, there are 5 comparators that will perform different comparing method of the chosen the
sorting type. The list of person will be rearranged after the *sortPerson()* method is executed.

[NOTE]
If sorting type is not found, an error message will to shown in the result display to notfiy the user of an unknown
sorting
type.

Sorting *Name* and *Tag* are done using the default comparator as they are only sorted alphabetically.


*Company* and *Position* have a default input, _"NIL"_, if it is not specified during the adding of the person,
they should be sorted to the bottom of the list.

*Priority* has the default input of priority is "L". They can be categorise into *three* different types, _H_, _M_
and _L_. Priorities with the type as _"L"_ has to be at the bottom of the list with _"M"_ in the middle and _"H"_ at
the top.

Since *Company*, *Position* and *Priority* have specific way of sorting, a custom comparator would be needed in order
 to get the arrangement that is most suited for the user.

The *_ORDERED_ENTRIES_* indicates how should it should be sorted in both the comparator for *Company*, *Position* and
 *Priority*.

The implementation of the comparator for *Company* and *Position* are the same. For *Position*, simply change all the
variables and data type to be *Position*.

An example of the implementation for *Company* is as follows:

[source, java]
----
private static final String ORDERED_ENTRIES = "NIL";

public int compareTo(Company company) {
    if (ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(company.toString()) && ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(this.toString())) {
        return ORDERED_ENTRIES.indexOf(this.toString()) - ORDERED_ENTRIES.indexOf(company.toString());
    }
    if (ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(company.toString())) {
        return 1;
    }
    if (ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(this.toString())) {
        return -1;
    }
    return company.toString().compareToIgnoreCase(this.toString());
}
public int compare(Company companyOne, Company companyTwo) {
    return companyOne.compareTo(companyTwo);
}
----

The implementation of the comparator for *Priority* is as follows:

[source, java]
----
private static final String ORDERED_ENTRIES = "L, M, H";

public int compareTo(Priority priority) {
    if (ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(priority.toString()) && ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(this.toString())) {
        return ORDERED_ENTRIES.indexOf(priority.toString()) - ORDERED_ENTRIES.indexOf(this.toString());
    }
    if (ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(priority.toString())) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (ORDERED_ENTRIES.contains(this.toString())) {
        return 1;
    }
        return priority.toString().compareTo(this.toString());
    }
    @Override
    public int compare(Priority priorityOne, Priority priorityTwo) {
        return priorityOne.compareTo(priorityTwo);
    }
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations:
*Aspect*: Implementation of Sorting

*Alternative 1*: Just sort all the different types alphabetically.

*Pros*: The user is able to see the person list sorted alphabetically for each sorting method

*Cons*: User may not want to sort them just alphabetically, the user may want a certain specific format of how the
list should be sorted for example priority should be sorted with *H* and the top, *M* in the middle and *L* at the
bottom.

*Alternative 2 (current choice)*: Have the sorting method to deal with such specifications.

*Pros*: Users is able to sort alphabetically automatically for all the sorting types provided.

*Cons*: Custom comparators will be required to compare the the sorting types that have a specific format.

// end::Sorting[]

// tag::SettingRelationship[]
=== Setting relationship between two persons

The setting of relationship mechanism is achieved by creating a new `SetRelCommand`, `SetRelCommandParser`
, `UniqueRelList` and `Relationship` classes. `SetRelCommand` and `SetRelCommandParser` classes resides in the `Logic
Component` and they are facilitated by `Relationship` and `UniqueRelList` classes that resides in the `Model Component`.
It supports the adding, deleting and clearing of relationship between two different persons. This command inherits the
`UndoableCommand` which allows the user to undo/redo the adding/deleting/clearing of relationship between two persons.

The implementation of `Relationship` is as follows:

[source, java]
----
public Relationship(String name) throws IllegalValueException {
    requireNonNull(name);
    String trimmedName = name.trim();
    if (!isValidRelType(trimmedName)) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_REL_CONSTRAINTS);
    }
    this.relType = name;
}

public Relationship(String name, Set<Relationship> relation) {
    this.relType = name + " " +  relation;
}
----

As you can see from the code above, the relationship name has to be validated to make sure it fits the a certain
format by checking if it matches the regular expression. The overloaded constructor concatenates the relationship
and the person's name.

Before a new instance of `SetRelCommand` is created,

SetRelCommmandParser ensures that:

1. the relationship prefix is present.
2. the indexes are the different.
3. the indexes are an unsigned integer.
4. there are 2 indexes present.
5. only one add relationship or delete relationship prefix present.
6. the relationships are not empty strings or null for adding and deleting.

`SetRelCommandParser` returns a new instance of `SetRelCommand` that takes in two indexes, an editedPerson
and a boolean value that states whether the add relationship prefix is present.

The implementation of `SetRelCommand` constructor is as follows:

[source, java]
----
public SetRelCommand(Index indexOne, Index indexTwo, EditPerson editPerson, boolean addPrefixPresent) {
    requireNonNull(indexOne);
    requireNonNull(indexTwo);

    this.indexOne = indexOne;
    this.indexTwo = indexTwo;
    this.editPerson = editPerson;
    this.addPrefixPresent = addPrefixPresent;
}
----

The execution of the command is done in the following method:

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

    if ((indexOne.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) || (indexTwo.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size())) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
    }

    ReadOnlyPerson personToEditOne = lastShownList.get(indexOne.getZeroBased());
    ReadOnlyPerson personToEditTwo = lastShownList.get(indexTwo.getZeroBased());
    Person editedPersonOne = createEditedPerson(personToEditOne, editPerson, personToEditTwo);
    Person editedPersonTwo = createEditedPerson(personToEditTwo, editPerson, personToEditOne);

    if (addPrefixPresent && (personToEditOne.getRelation().toString().contains(personToEditTwo.getName().toString())
        || personToEditTwo.getRelation().toString().contains(personToEditOne.getName().toString()))) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NO_MULTIPLE_REL);
    }
    try {
        model.updatePerson(personToEditOne, editedPersonOne);
        model.updatePerson(personToEditTwo, editedPersonTwo);
    } catch (DuplicatePersonException dpe) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
    } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
        throw new AssertionError("The target person cannot be missing");
    }
    model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_EDIT_PERSON_SUCCESS, editedPersonOne, editedPersonTwo));
}
----

The idea of how the adding/deleting and clearing would be done was inspired to me by my course mate, Sim Yan Yu
(syy94). However, the implementations are modified significantly to fit this feature.

The implementations of adding/deleting are as follows:

[source, java]
----
public Optional<Set<Relationship>> getToAddRel(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    Set<Relationship> relWithName = new HashSet<>();
    if ((addRel == null)) {
        return Optional.ofNullable(null);
    }
    relWithName.add(new Relationship(person.getName().toString(), addRel));

    return Optional.of(relWithName);
}

public Optional<Set<Relationship>> getToDeleteRel(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    Set<Relationship> relWithName = new HashSet<>();
    relWithName.add(new Relationship(person.getName().toString(), deleteRel));
    return Optional.of(relWithName);
}
----

After a series of method calls, the *model.updatePerson()* will eventually call the *setPerson()* method in
UniquePersonList.

The following sequence diagram shows how the set relationship operation works:

image::SetRelCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations:
*Aspect*: Setting relationships for contacts

*Alternative 1*: Manually setting the relationship for each person.

*Pros*: Able to delete relationship for a specific person.

*Cons*: Double work needed to set relationship between 2 persons.

*Alternative 2 (current choice)*: Make a new command that allows two persons to be added together.

*Pros*: Less work needed for the user has the command requires two person indexes.

*Cons*: New logic required to accept two indexes instead of one.

// end::SettingRelationship[]

// tag::Aliases[]
=== Command: Aliases

The checking of commands mechanism is achieved by creating a new `CheckCommandsParser` class that checks if the
command entered by the user can be found as aliases/synonyms of other commands.

This class returns the relevant command name back to `AddressBookParser` which returns an instance of the command
based on the command name that was returned.

An example of the implementation of how the checking of command checks is as follows:

In `AddressBookParser`:
[source, java]
----
private static CheckCommandsParser checkCommand = new CheckCommandsParser();

String commandWord = matcher.group("commandWord");
commandWord = checkCommand.matchCommand(commandWord);
final String arguments = matcher.group("arguments");

switch (commandWord) {
    case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
    return new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments);
----

An example of the implementation of checking the *add* command in `CheckCommandsParser` is as follows:
[source, java]
----
/**
 * used to store the userCommand in a set
 */
Set<String> userInputCommand = new HashSet<>();
userInputCommand.add(userCommand);

/**
 * All the synonyms/aliases of the different commands
 */
final String[] subAddCommands = new String[] { "add", "a", "input", "create", "insert" };

/**
 * Sets all the strings in each command into a HashSet
 */
final Set<String> commandsForAdd = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(subAddCommands));

/**
 * Compares the userInputCommand with the different commands set
 */
if (!Collections.disjoint(userInputCommand, commandsForAdd)) {
    finalUserCommand = "add";
}
----

The code for the other commands will be the same except for the aliases/synonyms.

[NOTE]
If the input command does not match with any of the *aliases/synonyms*, an exception will be thrown and an error
message will be shown to notify the user that the command entered is *invalid*.

==== Design Considerations:
*Aspect*: Implementation of aliases/synonyms for each command

*Alternative 1*: Adding many aliases case to the `AddressBookParser` switch cases.

*Pros*: Checks immediately at the `AddressBookParser` class

*Cons*: Required to add all the aliases/synonyms to each command class and adding all of them to the switch cases in
`AddressBookParser`.

*Alternative 2 (current choice)*: Create a class that checks the command entered

*Pros*: There is no need to add all the aliases/synonyms to each command class.

*Cons*: Required to pass the command to the other class to check instead of being able to check directly at
`AddressBookParser`.

// end::Aliases[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels ar created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
