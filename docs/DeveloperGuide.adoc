== Welcome to Planno

Planno is a Java application that helps users to conveniently manage contact as well as event details. To achieve this, Planno provides a large number of simple commands for users. +

There are many ways to contribute to Planno: coding, testing, improving the build process and tools, or contributing to the documentation. This guide provides information that will not only help you get started as a Planno contributor, but that you'll find it useful to refer to even if you are already an experienced contributor. +

This developer guide aims to give future programmers who hope to modify this application a general description of the architecture and design of the Desktop Application Planno.
Planno provides users a platform to store and manage people's contact information, and events related to people in Planno. This developer guide consists of the following sections:

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

To set up the project in your computer, please follow the following steps:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +

The above steps will help you generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1: Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* _(Figure 3.1.1)_ given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component:

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, you can modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* (At app launch) Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* (At app shut down) Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by other components. Among them, the following two classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class is written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]. Components communicate with each other by posting event in this class (i.e. a form of event-driven nature of design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four major components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : Displays the user interface.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : Executes the command.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components above

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The *_Sequence Diagram_* _(Figure 3.1.2)_ below shows how the components interact using `EventsCenter` for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
The `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below _(Figure 3.1.3)_ shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
The event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.
----
The sections below give you more details of each component.
----

=== Four major components
==== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1: Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The structure of the `UI` Component is shown in the *_Class Diagram_* _(Figure 2.2.1)_ above. The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== Logic component

The diagrams _(Figure 3.2.2.1 to Figure 3.2.2.3)_ given below show the structure of whole logic component, and structure of commands in details. +

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.2.1: Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.2.2: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3.2.2.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

Figure 3.2.2.1 shows the structure of the `Logic` component. The `LogicManager` firstly calls the `AddressBookParser` to parse the user input.

This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. Then, the command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the *_Sequence Diagram_* _(Figure 3.2.2.3)_ for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.2.3: Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

// tag::model[]
==== Model component

The following diagram _(Figure 3.2.3)_ shows the class structure of the Model component.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.3: Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

Generally, the `Model` is managed by a Model manager, which

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* maintains an `AddressBook` and a `EventList`.
* stores 2 unmodifiable list: `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` and `ObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent>`. They are bounded to UI so that the UI can automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

In detail, the `AddressBook` and the `EventList` are respectively responsible for person and event information.

* The `AddressBook`
** stores people's information as a person list with no duplicate persons. The information includes one's personal information and contact details.
** keeps track of all the tags that had been added to some people in the person list
** for each person in the list, the person holds a modifiable tag list that contains all the tag this person has.

* The `EventList`
** stores event's information as an event list.
** for each event in the list, the event maintains a modifiable list to keep track of who the participants of the events are.
// end::model[]

==== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.4: Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The diagram _(Figure 3.2.4)_ above shows the structure of the `Storage` component.
The `StorageManager` handles the saving and loading of data for both `AddressBookStorage` and `EventStorage`.
`XmlSerializableAddressBook` and `XmlSerializableEventStorage` handle the conversion from Java to Xml format using `XmlAdaptedPerson`, `XmlAdaptedEvent` and `XmlAdaptedTag`.

The `Storage` component:

* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* Saves the Address Book data in xml format and reads it back.
* Saves event storage data in xml format and reads it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
For the features described in this section, their design considerations are included where applicable.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism
==== General implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram _(Figure 3.1.1.1)_ shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.1: Structure of commands_

As you can see from the diagram _(Figure 4.1.1.1)_, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of Planno before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...
        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
    protected abstract void undo();
}

[source,java]
public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
    @Override
    protected void undo() {
        // ... undo delete logic ...
    }
}


Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command). This is shown in the image _(Figure 4.1.1.2)_ below.

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.2: undo example part 1_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person. This is show in the image _(Figure 4.1.1.3)_ below.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.3: undo example part 2_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed. This is shown in the image _(Figure 4.1.1.4)_ below.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.4: undo example part 3_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.1.1.5)_ shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequencediagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.5: undo sequential diagram_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow). This is shown in the image _(Figure 3.1.1.6)_ below.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.6: redo example part 1_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution. This is shown in the image _(Figure 4.1.1.7)_ below.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.7: redo example part 2_

The following *_activity diagram_* _(Figure 4.1.1.8)_ summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command.

[discrete]
===== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. +
**Alternative 2:** Save the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`) +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +

---

*The following sections detail the specific implementation of undo and redo for each type of `UndoableCommand`:* +

==== Undo an adding command
* We keep the person added by that command.
* To undo it, we delete it from the address book.
* To redo it, we re-add it to the address book.

[NOTE]
The person is associated with a list of tags, and we need to eliminate them when we undo. +

.The process is as follows:
.. When we add a person to address book:
1. Extract all tags which are associated with this person but not in the tag list before executing add command. +
2. Keep the tags extracted in step 1 in another list named `newTags`. +
3. Continue executing add command. +
.. When we undo this add command:
1. Delete the person from address book. +
2. Remove all tags which are in `newTags` from the tag list in the address book. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Add this person into address book (Since newTags already exists).

---

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How to deal with tags when we undo add command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove all tags which only exists in this person +
**Pros:** This allows the add command to be undone completely. +
**Cons:** Need to ensure each tag that is supposed to be removed does not exist in any other person. +
**Alternative 2:** Do not remove any tag +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Tag list is not reverted to the state before add command executes.

==== Undo an delete command
* We keep the person to be deleted, and his position in the address book.
* To undo it, we add this person to the original position in the address book.
* To redo it, we delete this person from the address book.

.The process is as follows:
.. When we delete a person from the address book:
1. Get the target person by `index`. +
2. Store both target person and the `index`. +
3. Continue executing delete command. +
.. When we undo this delete command:
1. Add target person to the position `index`. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Delete the target person. +

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Where to add the target person when we undo the delete person +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add it to the original position `index` +
**Pros:** This allows the delete command to be undone completely, and the sequence of persons in address book will not change because of the undo. +
**Cons:** Need to spend more time adding a person back to its original position in the middle of the list, because it requires all persons behind `index` to switch to right. +
**Alternative 2:** Just add it at the back of address book +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, and more efficient. +
**Cons:** The sequence of persons in address book will change. +

---

==== Undo an edit command
* We keep the `personToEdit` and the `editedPerson`.
* To undo it, we swap the role of `personToEdit` and `editedPerson`, and edit it.
* To redo it, we swap back the role and re-edit it.

[NOTE]
Similar as `add` command, if the `editedPerson` causes some change in `tagList`, we need to remove such tags accordingly. +

.The process is as follows:
.. When we edit a person to address book:
1. Extract all tags which are associated with `editedPerson` but not in the tag list before executing edit command. +
2. Keep the tags extracted in step 1 in another list named `newTags`. +
3. Continue executing add command. +
.. When we undo this edit command:
1. Swap the role of `personToEdit` and `editedPerson`. +
2. Execute edit operation. +
3. Remove all tags which are in `newTags` from the tag list in the address book. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Swap back the role of `personToEdit` and `editedPerson`
2. Execute edit operation (Since newTags already exists). +

---

==== Undo an clear command
* We keep the whole copy of address book for undo clear command.
* To undo it, we reset the data of the address book.
* To redo it, we clear the address book again.

.The process is as follows:
.. When we clear the address book:
1. Keep a copy of the address book. +
2. Assign an empty address book to clear the address book. +
.. When we undo this clear command:
1. Reset the data as the copy of address book. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Assign an empty address book to the model. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism
The Find mechanism is facilitated by `NameContainsKeyWordPredicate` class, which resides in `model.person` package. This command
allows users to find a list of persons by tag and name keywords. A person that has at least one of the keywords will be selected.
Such command will inherit from `Command`.

The find command accepts two types of keywords:

* `tag`: it is identified by a prefix `t/`. +
e.g. `find t/friends` means to find any person that have a tag called `friends`
* `name`: anything that does not begin with `tag` is identified as `name` keyword. +
e.g. `find friends` means to find any person whose name contains the keyword `friends`
[NOTE]
if a `tag name` is not preceded with a prefix `t/`, then the `tag name` will be identified as a `person name`. As a result, the people with their name containing the `tag name` will be displayed.

The mechanism for `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` to select people is implemented this way:
[source,java]
@Override
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
	boolean isSelected = keywords.stream().anyMatch （keyword –>
 			StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword));
	// check whether this person’s name contains any of the name key word
	If (isSelected == true) {
		return isSelected;
	}
	for (String keyword : keywords) {
		If (keyword.length() >= 2 && keyword.substring(0, 2).equals(“t/”) {
			String tagName = “[” + keyword.substring(2) + “]”;
			for(Tag tag : person.getTags()) {
				if (tag.toString().equals(tagName)) {
 					isSelected = true;
 		}}}
	return isSelected;
}

Below is a *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.2)_ for executing a find command: `find t/friends`. It will find persons that have the tag `friends`.

image::findSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2: sequence diagram for find command_

The command will be sent to `LogicManager`, and `LogicManager` will call `AddressBookParser` to parse
the command. Subsequently, `FindCommandParser` will parse the argument `t/friends` and create a new `findCommand` with
predicate `t/friends`. Then `LogicManager` will execute `findCommand` to update the filtered person list with predicate `friends`.

This update will notify GUI to update the filtered person list,
so that the persons with the tag `friends` is displayed.

[discrete]
==== Design considerations

---
**Aspect:**  Implementation of find command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Select people that have any of the keywords +
**Pros:** We only need to ensure that at least one keyword exists for every person.   +
**Cons:**  It is difficult to know by which keyword a person is selected. +
**Alternative 2:** Select people that has any of the keywords, and highlight selected keywords in each person's `person card` +
**Pros:** Shows clearly what keywords each selected person contains. +
**Cons:**  We need to go through everything of a person, in order to highlight EVERY keyword the person has. +

---
**Aspect:** Types of keywords that can be found +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only person name and tag can be used in the find command +
**Pros:** We only need to check a person's name and tag list to find any matches. +
**Cons:** User will not be able to find a person by other information such as phone or email. +
**Alternative 2:** we allow every information of a person (i.e. phone, email, address) to be used as keywords in the find command. +
**Pros:** A person can be found in many ways. +
**Cons:** Implementation is complicated.
// end::find[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The sort command is facilitated by the `LogicManager` class. It supports sorting contact list and makes it easier for users to find contacts according to alphabetical order of their names. Moreover, it can also help users to sort the event list in the meantime according to their dates so that users can decide to process which event first.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.3)_ shows how the sort command works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3: sequence diagram for sort command_

When user enters a sort command, it will be received by `LogicManager`.Then, `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. And `AddressBookParser` will create `SortCommand` command object and returns it.When `LogicManager` receives the command object, it will execute it.

The `SortCommand` object calls `sortPersons()` and `sortEvents()` in the `Model`as follow:
[source, java]
public class SortCommand extends Command {
    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "sort";
    public static final String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "Sorted all persons and events";
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        model.sortPersons();
        model.sortEvents();
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }
}

And This is how `Model` update the person list and event list using `sortPersons()` and `sortEvents()` :
[source, java]
    public synchronized void sortPersons() {
        addressBook.sortPersons();
        updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
    }
    public synchronized void sortEvents() {
        eventList.sortEvents();
        updateFilteredEventList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS);
    }

In the address book, we will sort contacts according to alphabetical order of their names:
[source, java]
    public void sort() {
        Collections.sort(internalList, new Comparator<Person>() {
            public int compare (Person p1, Person p2) {
                return p1.getName().toString().compareToIgnoreCase(p2.getName().toString()); } });
    }

In the event list, we will sort events according to their dates;
[source, java]
    public void sort() {
        Collections.sort(internalList, new Comparator<Event>() {
            public int compare (Event p1, Event p2) {
                return p1.getEventTime().orderForSort().compareTo(p2.getEventTime().orderForSort()); } });
    }

After sorting the person list and the event list, `SortCommand` will create `CommandResult` object and return it. And `LogicManager` receives `CommandResult` and shows related message through `UI`.

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** How sort command affects the data in the person list +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the copy of contact list and return it +
**Pros:** It is more defensive and keeps the data unchanged. +
**Cons:** Users have to sort the list every time when they open the application. +
**Alternative 2:** Sort the actual contact list and return it +
**Pros:** Users do not need to type the command every time. +
**Cons:** Sort command is not undoable which means that the order of list cannot change anymore after you call it. It is also less defensive because you can frequently change the original data. +

---

**Aspect:** How sort command executes for the person list+
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the contact list according to alphabetical order (ascending order) +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Users do not have other choices to sort the person list. +
**Alternative 2:** Sort the contact list according to different order (ascending order or descending order) +
**Pros:** Users will have more choices. +
**Cons:** It will be more complex for developers to maintain and test. +

---

**Aspect:** What can be sorted in the person list +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort contacts according to their names +
**Pros:** It is useful and necessary for general users. +
**Cons:** Users do not have other choices to sort the person list. +
**Alternative 2:** Sort contacts according to their addresses/emails/phone numbers +
**Pros:** It provides more choices for users. +
**Cons:** Because address/email/phone number is unique, you can usually find them without sorting the list. +
// end::sort[]

// tag::addE[]
=== AddEvent mechanism
The add event command is facilitated by `LogicManager` class. It allows user to add a new event to the event list. +

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.4)_ shows how add event command works:

image::AddEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4: AddEvent command sequence diagram_

The user enters an addEvent command, and the command is received by `LogicManager`. Then `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command.
`AddressBookParser` will first check the format of the parameters. If the format is valid, it constructs a new `AddEventCommand` object.
`Logic Manager` then executes `AddEventCommand` to add the event into `Model`.
Then `Logic Manager` will return the command result generated by `AddEventCommand` to `UI`. +
// end::addE[]

// tag::listE[]
=== ListEvent mechanism

The list event command is facilitated by the `LogicManager` class. It supports listing all the events for users to process.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.5)_ shows how the list event command works:

image::ListEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5: sequence diagram for list command_

When user enters a listE command, it will be received by `LogicManager`. The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. Then, `AddressBookParser` creates the `ListEventCommand` object and returns it. When `LogicManager` receives `ListEventCommand`, it will execute the command.

When `ListEventCommand` is executed, it will call `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` as follows:

[source, java]
public class ListEventCommand extends Command {
    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "listE";
    public static final String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "Listed all events";
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        model.updateFilteredEventList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS);
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }
}

After `Model` updates filtered event list which will be shown in the GUI, `ListEventCommand` will create `CommandResult` object and returns it. And `LogicManager` receives `CommandResult` and shows related message through `UI`.

// end::listE[]

// tag::deleteE[]
=== DeleteEvent mechanism

The delete event command is facilitated by the `LogicManager`. It supports `undo` and `redo` as it inherits from `UndoableCommand`. Other delete commands are implemented similarly.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.6)_ below shows how the delete event operation works:

image::DeleteEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6: sequence diagram for deleteE command_

The user enters a deleteE command which is received by `LogicManger`.
`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the user command.
`AddressBookParser` creates an `DeleteEventCommand` object and returns it.
`LogicManager` receives the `Command` object and executes it.
The `DeleteEventCommand` calls `deleteEvent()` in the `Model`.
`Model` will proceed to delete the event.
The `DeleteEventCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` object and returns it to `LogicManager`.
`LogicManager` receives the result and displays it through the `UI`.

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteEventCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new command to delete events +
**Pros:** It is responsible only for deleting events, and not people. Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** Users may accidentally type in "delete" for deleting a person instead of "deleteE" for deleting an event. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify `DeleteCommand` to handle deletion for both persons and events +
**Pros:** Users would be less likely to type the wrong command. +
**Cons:** Any changes to the deletion process of either a person or event may affect the other. Harder to implement. +

---

**Aspect:** How deleteE command executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes the event at the specified index +
**Pros:** Easy to imlement. +
**Cons:** User has to list/sort event list first. +
**Alternative 2:** Delete the event with the specified name +
**Pros:** Users can delete directly without having to get the index. +
**Cons:** Users would have to type more if the event name is long. It will be more complex for developers to maintain and test. +

// end::deleteE[]

// tag::showP[]
=== ShowParticipants mechanism

The show participants mechanism is facilitated by `PersonJoinsEventsPredicate`, which resides in `model.person` package. This command will help users to find participants of an event. For achieving this function, `PersonJoinsEventsPredicate` will filter the person list. This command inherits from `Command`.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.7)_ for executing a show participants command: `showP 3`. It will show all the participants of the third event in the current list.:

image::ShowParticipantsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7: sequence diagram for showP INDEX command_

When user enters a `showP 3` command, it will be received by `LogicManager`. And `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. Then `AddressBookParser` will create `ShowParticipantsCommandParser` to parse `3`.

After `ShowParticipantsCommandParser` parses the index `3`, it will create `ShowParticipantsCommand` object with this index as follows:

[source, java]
    public ShowParticipantsCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        try {
            Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
            return new ShowParticipantsCommand(index);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(
                    String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, ShowParticipantsCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }

Then `AddressBookParser` receives the command object and returns it to `LogicManager`. When `LogicManager` receives `ShowParticipantsCommand` object, it will execute it.

`ShowParticipantsCommand` will create the `PersonJoinsEventsPredicate` which is `p` in the diagram using the index given and use this predicate to update the person list as follows:

[source, java]
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        List<ReadOnlyEvent> lastShownList = model.getFilteredEventList();
        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_EVENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }
        eventToShow = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        String name = eventToShow.getEventName().fullEventName;
        PersonJoinsEventsPredicate predicate = new PersonJoinsEventsPredicate(name);
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate);
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SHOW_PARTICIPANTS_SUCCESS, eventToShow.getEventName()));
    }

And that is how `PersonJoinsEventsPredicate` filters the person list:
[source, java]
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        Boolean isSelected = false;
        if (!person.getParticipation().isEmpty()) {
            for (ReadOnlyEvent event: person.getParticipation()) {
                if (!isSelected) {
                    isSelected = keywords.equals(event.getEventName().fullEventName);
                }
            }
        }
        return isSelected;
    }

After `Model` updates the person list which will be shown in the GUI, the `ShowParticipantsCommand` object will create `CommandResult` object and returns it. And `LogicManager` receives `CommandResult` and shows related message through `UI`.

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How show participants command executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show participants of the event at the specified index +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Sometimes users have to list all the events so that they can get all the indexes. +
**Alternative 2:** Show participants of the event with the specified name +
**Pros:** Users can use the command without listing events. +
**Cons:** Users need more time to type if the event name is too long. +
// end::showP[]

// tag::selectE[]
=== ShowAllJoinedEvent mechanism

The selectE command is facilitated by the `LogicManager`. This command inherits from `Command`.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.8)_ show how the show all joined events operation works:

image::ShowAllJoinedEventsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.8: sequence diagram for selectE command_

As seen in the *_sequence diagram_* (Figure 4.8) above, when the user enters a selectE command, the input is parsed by the `SelectJoinedEventsCommandParser`.
A `SelectJoinedEventsCommand` is then created from the parsed user input.
When the `LogicManager` executes the `SelectJoinedEventsCommand`, the latter calls `getFilteredPersonList()` to get the current person list.
The `SelectJoinedEventsCommand` will then check the entered index values and get the names of the events the person/s have participated.
This is shown in the code snippet below:

[source,java]
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    for (Index targetIndex: indexList) {
                if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                    throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
                }
                personNames.append(lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()).getName()).append(", ");
                for (ReadOnlyEvent event: lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()).getParticipation()) {
                    eventNames.append(event.getEventName()).append("[-]");
                }
            }
}

As seen in the code snippet above, the `SelectJoinedEventsCommand` will throw an exception if the entered index values are invalid and will combine the participated event names into a String named "eventNames".
The `SelectJoinedEventsCommand` will then separate the event names using the combination of symbols, "[-]", so they can be used by a predicate to find the participated events.
This is shown in the code snippet below:

[source,java]
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    String[] eventNameKeywords = (eventNames.toString().trim()).split("\\[-]+");
            EventContainsKeywordPredicate predicate = new EventContainsKeywordPredicate(Arrays.asList(eventNameKeywords));
            // Update the UI and return result.
}

As shown in the code snippet above, the event names will be separated and stored in a String[] named "eventNameKeywords".
A `EventContainsKeywordPredicate` will be created and will use the "eventNameKeywords" to find the events that are participated by the entered person/s.
The UI will then be updated to display the events found.

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How selectE command executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Shows events joined by person/s at the selected indexes +
**Pros:** User does not have to type out names. +
**Cons:** User has to list/sort person list first. +
**Alternative 2:** Show events joined by person/s using user entered name +
**Pros:** User can directly enter names to search for events where a person with the entered name has joined. +
**Cons:** Users would have to type more if the name is long. User may mistype the name. +
// end::selectE[]

// tag::interaction[]
=== Person-Event interaction
Events and persons can be connected (i.e.joined) if a person participates in an event. The connected relationship can also be disjoined. We will explain the implementation of the relationship in terms of Model and Storage.
[discrete]
==== Model level
For model, we simply use a "referencing model" to show the relationship between person and event, as shown in the following diagram. +

image::DG_model_join.png[width = "800"]
_Figure 4.9.1: interaction model_

There is a participant list in the Event model, which stores all the persons who are involved in this event.
Similarly, the participation list in Person model stores all the event in which this person joins.

Hence, we need to maintain both lists when operating `join` and `disjoin` commands. The two commands are implemented in a similar way.
Take `disjoin` command as the example, and `join` command uses the same idea to implement. The command will call `ModelManager` 's quitEvent() method to connect the person and the event.
The following code segment from `ModelManager`shows how `quitEvent()` operates:

[source,java]
public void disjoin(Person personToRemove, Event eventToRemove) {
    eventList.remove(personToRemove); //Maintain participantList in Event
    personList.remove(eventToRemove); //Maintain participationList in Person
    // Save changes to the storage.
}

`AddressBook` and `EventList` will then locate the person/event-to-remove in its list, and perform deletion.

[discrete]
==== Storage level
In storage, we cannot use the `referencing model` which is used in the `Model` component. This is because that it is easy to have an *Infinity loop of reference*. As shown in the diagram _(Figure 3.9.2)_ below,
an event A references a person X, and X references another event B, and B continues to reference another person Y....As a result, the referencing list will be incredibly long:

image::DG_infinity loop.png[width = "800"]
_Figure 4.9.2: infinity loop_

To solve the *infinity loop reference*, we create two storage entities: `XmlAdaptedEventNoParticipant` and `XmlAdaptedPersonNoParticipation` for referencing purposes. Both of them do not have participant or participation information.
Hence, we can avoid the infinity referencing problem. +
The updated storage is shown in the diagram _(Figure 4.9.3)_ below:

image::DG_join_storage.png[width = "800"]
_Figure 4.9.3: interaction storage_

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to implement person-event interaction +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set `participationList` in Person, and `participantList` in Event. They reference each other +
**Pros:** This is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** We need to maintain both lists when operating `join` and `disjoin`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use association class +
**Pros:** This allows us to save every participation entry. +
**Cons:** We need to implement extra storage for association class, and it is costly in terms of time to operate `show person` and `select event`.
// end::interaction[]

// tag::portrait[]
=== Portrait Command mechanism
The portrait command is facilitated by `LogicManager` and is extended from `UndoableCommand`. +
The following diagram _(Figure 4.10.1)_ shows the structure of PortraitPath class:

image::DG_Portrait class.png[]
_Figure 4.10.1 PortraitPath class structure_

As shown in above diagram, we only store a string value, which is the file path in this class.
We only load the image file in the UI component.

The portrait can only be changed by this command. In other words, `Add`command can only create a person without a portrait. +

However, users may type a wrong path. As we only load it in the UI component, we will only know if any errors occur when it reaches the UI component, which makes handling exceptions harder as they are usually handled in the Logic component.
Therefore, we apply defensive coding here. We check whether the file can be loaded before modifying the person's information.
If not, we can throw an exception in the Logic component rather than UI component, which is much easier to handle. The following *_activity diagram_* _(Figure 4.10.2)_ shows the flow as explained before:

image::DG_preload.png[]
_Figure 4.10.2 defensive code for loading file_

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to store the portrait. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Only store the path in .xml file, and only load the image in UI. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, and save the memory. +
**Cons:** Cannot move the image file in the computer, otherwise the user needs to change the path. +
**Alternative 2:** Store the image file. +
**Pros:** No need to load the image every time. +
**Cons:** Hard to store images into .xml file. +
// end::portrait[]

// tag::toggle[]
=== Toggle mechanism
The toggle mechanism is an event-driven mechanism. The following diagram _(Figure 4.11.1)_ below shows the overview of the high-level interactions between components for the toggle mechanism:

image::DG_ToggleComponents.png[]
_Figure 4.11.1 Toggle mechanism component interactions_

The following sequence diagram _(Figure 4.11.2)_ below show how the first half of the toggle mechanism works up till the posting of the event:

image::DG_Toggle1.png[]
_Figure 4.11.2 Toggle mechanism sequence 1_

As seen in the sequence diagram _(Figure 4.11.2)_ above, when the user enters a toggle command, a `ToggleCommand` is created.
When the `LogicManager` executes the `ToggleCommand`, the `EventsCenter` will post a `TogglePanelEvent` to the `EventBus` which is shown in the code snippet below:

[source,java]
public class ToggleCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new TogglePanelEvent());
        // ... Return CommandResult ...
    }
}

The following sequence diagram _(Figure 4.11.3)_ below shows the second half of the toggle mechanism starting with the handling of the posted event:

image::DG_Toggle2.png[]
_Figure 4.11.3 Toggle mechanism sequence 2_

As seen in the sequence diagram _(Figure 4.11.3)_ above, the event is handled by the `TogglePanel`.
The `TogglePanel` has a variable called `browserIsFront` which keeps track of whether the browser is currently displayed.
`TriggerToggle` uses `browserIsFront` to toggle the correct panel to the front and updates `browserToFront` accordingly.
This is shown in the code snippet below:

[source,java]
public class TogglePanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleTogglePanelEvent(TogglePanelEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        triggerToggle();
    }
    private void triggerToggle() {
        if (browserIsFront) {
            browserToBack();
        } else {
            browserToFront();
        }
    }
    private void browserToFront() {
        browserPlaceHolder.setVisible(true);
        browserPlaceHolder.toFront();
        toggleSplitPane.setVisible(false);
        toggleSplitPane.toBack();
        browserIsFront = true;
    }
    private void browserToBack() {
        browserPlaceHolder.setVisible(false);
        browserPlaceHolder.toBack();
        toggleSplitPane.setVisible(true);
        toggleSplitPane.toFront();
        browserIsFront = false;
    }
}

As seen from the above code snippet, when `browserIsFront` is true, the place holder where the browser is at, will be sent to the back and made to be invisible. While the `toggleSplitPane`, which holds the information board and events list, is brought to the front and made visible. `BrowserIsFront` is then set to be false.
When `browserIsFront` is false, the opposite happens. The place holder with the browser is brought to the front and made visible, while the `toggleSplitPane` is sent to the back and made to be invisible. +

One thing to take note of with the select command, is that the browser will be brought to the front and displayed regardless of the current status of `browserIsFront`.
This is shown in the code snippet below:

[source,java]
public class BrowserPanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadPersonPage(event.getNewSelection().person);
        raise(new ToggleSelectEvent());
    }
}

[source,java]
public class TogglePanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleToggleSelectEvent(ToggleSelectEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        browserToFront();
    }
}

As seen from the above code snippet, the `BrowserPanel` handles the event posted whenever the select command is executed.
It does so by raising a `ToggleSelectEvent`, which the `TogglePanel` handles by calling `browserToFront` method which will set the browser to be at the front.

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to implement the toggle mechanism. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Use a toggle panel to hold the containers of the browser, information board and events list. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. Visibility depends on the containers, any modification will not touch the code of the actual panels much if at all. +
**Cons:** Will need to adjust the FXML file when changes are made to what is togglable. +
**Alternative 2:** Have each togglable panel know how to toggle. +
**Pros:** No need change the FXML file when changes are made to what is togglable. +
**Cons:** Will have to make large changes to the actual panels themselves. +
// end::toggle[]

// tag::findE[]
=== FindEvent mechanism
The find event mechanism is facilitated by `EventNameContainsKeyWordPredicate` class, which resides in `model.event` package. This command
supports users of finding a list of events by their names. Any event that has either of the entered keyword will be filtered
into the list. This command inherits from `Command`.

Below is a *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 4.12)_ for executing a find event command: `findE first`. It will find events which contain keyword `first` in their names.

image::FindEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.12: sequence diagram for find event command_

When users enters a `findE first`, `LogicManager` will receive it and call `AddressBookParser` to parse command. In the `AddressBookParser`, it will create `FindEventParser` to parse `first`.

Then `FindEventCommandParser` will parse argument `first` and create a new `FindEventCommand` object with `EventNameContainsKeywordPredicate` which is `p` in the diagram:
[source, java]
    public FindEventCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        String trimmedArgs = args.trim();
        if (trimmedArgs.isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(
                    String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, FindEventCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
        String[] nameKeywords = trimmedArgs.split("\\s+");
        return new FindEventCommand(new EventNameContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(nameKeywords)));
    }

`FindEventCommand` will use the predicate to update the event list by calling `updateFilteredEventList(p)` method in the `Model`.

And This is how `EventNameContainsPredicate` filters the event list:
[source, java]
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyEvent event) {
        return keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(event.getEventName().fullEventName, keyword));
    }

After `Model` updates the event list which will be shown in the GUI, the `FindEventCommand` object will create `CommandResult` object and returns it. And `LogicManager` receives `CommandResult` and shows related message through `UI`.

[discrete]
==== Design considerations

**Aspect:**  Implementation of find event command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Select events that have any of the keywords in their names +
**Pros:**  It is easier for users to find events without knowing their full names. +
**Cons:**  Users may get more unwanted results in the event list. +
**Alternative 2:** Select events that have all the keywords in their names +
**Pros:** Users can find the event they want accurately. +
**Cons:** Sometimes it is hard for users to remember the full name of an event. +

// end::findE[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot _(Figure 5.3)_ below.

== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is `Method 3`. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. They are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. They are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Planno depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives: +
a. Including those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Requiring developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
