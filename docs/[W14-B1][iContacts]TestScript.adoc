== Introduction
This document explains the steps to perform manual testing, and how to load the sample data.

== Loading the Sample Data

The following are the steps to load sample data:

* Alternative 1 (easier)
. Create a new, empty folder and name it "iContacts". Place the iContacts JAR file within it.
. For the first command tested, run the JAR file as normal. A "data" folder will be created in the working directory of iContacts.
. For subsequent commands, delete the `addressbook.xml` and `reminders.xml` files inside the "data" folder.

* Alternative 2 (more troublesome)
. Create a new, empty folder and name it "iContacts". Place the iContacts JAR file within it.
. Extract the zipped file `[W14-B1][iContacts]SampleData.rar` to get the two xml files : `[W14-B1][iContacts]SampleData.xml` and `[W14-B1][iContacts]SampleRemindersData.xml` in a folder.
. Rename `[W14-B1][iContacts]SampleData.xml` and `[W14-B1][iContacts]SampleRemindersData.xml` to `addressbook.xml` and `reminders.xml` respectively.
. Move these 2 files into another empty folder.
. For the first command tested, run the JAR file as normal. A "data" folder will be created in the working directory of iContacts.
. For subsequent commands, copy-paste the `addressbook.xml` and `reminders.xml` files into the "data" folder. Overwrite the existing
`addressbook.xml` and `reminders.xml` files inside the "data" folder if need to.


[NOTE]
For path mentioned in below commands get the absolute path from your device and try the commands.
E.g. `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\My Files\mypic.jpg` (For Windows) +
E.g. `/Users/jpoh/Desktop/CS2103T/mypic.jpg` (On Mac)


== Commands to Test


=== Frequently Visited Contacts

Following are the commands which will increase the `PopularityCounter` by one for the contacts viewed/searched:

*** `viewtag`
*** `select`
*** `details` [special case when counter increases by 2 as it is a stronger indicator of who could be a frequently visited contact]
*** `location`
*** `email`

[NOTE]
Manual selection of person through a click also increases the popularity counter of that person. This is the same action as `details` command.


[NOTE]
To closely notice the changes, please reset the data by deleting the `addressbook.xml` and allowing our application to generate default contacts each with zero popularity( or replacing by sampledata file given). Initially everyone has zero popularity and ones added earlier in addressbook will be ranked higher in Frequently Visited List

Order of Events:

image::initialPC.PNG[width="400"]

. Initially you should see the above list in Popular contact

. `details 10` +
Index 10's popularity counter increased. +
Janice come on the #1 position

. `viewtag friends` +
Everyone with tag `friends` gets counter increased. +
Akshay comes on #4 position


. `list` +
`select 3` +
Charlotte's counter increases +
Charlotte's comes on #4 position before Akshay even though they have the same counter since, Charlotte was added before Akshay in address book

You can try other commands to see the updation of Popular Contact List.
