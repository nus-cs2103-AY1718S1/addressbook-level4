We are a team consisting of four members based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore]. +
We are currently Computer Science students pursuing an undergraduate degree here at NUS.
Our TeamID is `W13-B2`.

The `Weaver` application was developed by our team for our Software Engineering project mainly meant for NUS students.
It is adapted from the AddressBook - Level 4 that was developed by the https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html[se-edu] team. +
We have renamed the application as such so that it evokes a positive appeal among others. +
Weaver symbolises the weaving of out contacts in order to stay connected. +
