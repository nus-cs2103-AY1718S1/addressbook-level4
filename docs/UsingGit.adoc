https://git-scm.com/[Git] is a popular distributed version control software (VCS). It is used to track changes in
computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code
management in software development,but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

== Why Git?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds[Linus Torvalds] created Git in 2005 and he once wrote in the `README` file:

****
The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid
content tracker" and the name as (depending on your way):

- random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that
it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
- stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
- "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
- "g*dd*mn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

== Sync your fork with team account

Your personal fork of the repository on https://github.com/[GitHub] should always be even or ahead of `CS2103AUG2017-T09-B3:master`.

_Figure 2.1 : Sync your GitHub fork_

Open a shell and enter the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# See all your remotes.
git remote -vv

# Add team repository to your list of remotes (call it upstream).
git remote add upstream git@github.com:CS2103AUG2017-T09-B3/main.git

# See all your remotes, there should be one more now.
git remote -vv

# Fetch all branches from all remotes.
git fetch --all

# Merge the master branch from team repository to your current branch.
git merge upstream/master

# Add and commit all changes to your current branch.
git commit -am "Sync with upstream master"

# Push changes to the remote branch of your current branch.
git push
----

== Solve merge conflict

When you create a pull request (PR), you may face merge conflict if the destination branch and base branch both change some common parts.
In order to avoid merge conflict as much as possible, you should link:#sync-your-fork[sync your fork] frequently.

Open a shell and enter the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# Fetch all branches from all remotes.
git fetch --all

# Merge the master branch from team repository to your current branch.
git merge upstream/master
----

Git should tell you where the conflict happens now. Open your IDE or favorite text editor to change the conflicting part accordingly.

[source,shell]
----
# Add and commit all changes to your current branch.
git commit -am "Fix merge conflict"

# Push changes to the remote branch of your current branch.
git push
----

== Caution

The commands differ every time. You should see the hints Git give you to proceed.
