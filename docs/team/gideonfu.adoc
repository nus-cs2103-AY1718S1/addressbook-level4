== Project: OneBook
OneBook is a desktop Address Book application. It uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but most of the interactions happen using Command Line Interface (CLI).

OneBook is optimized for companies' usage. It is also suitable for general usage.

OneBook allows users to easily import and export contacts, send emails conveniently and stores a database of contacts.

=== Enhancement Added: Modify Delete command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=delete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Deleting contacts one by one can be extremely time consuming if the user wishes to delete many contacts. Having a `delete` command that simply allows for only one deletion is not suitable. The modified `delete` command is now able to delete multiple contacts in a single command by separating the indexes with a comma.

=== Enhancement Added: Modify Find command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Justification

By extending the `find` command to enable searching in the various fields, the utility given to users is greatly enhanced. For example, users will be able to find all persons in a given organisation, or all persons with a certain birthday month. Users can also find a particular person by searching for their phone number, address, or email.
