== Project: Codii
[https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main[Codii]] is a desktop address book application specially designed for debt collectors to manage debtors in a simple manner. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Debt collectors can store information such as the amount owed, debt borrow date and debt cleared date in addition to debtorâ€™s personal information.

Unique features such as an interest calculator help debt collectors manage debts more efficiently.

Codii is evolved from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4], which is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

=== Enhancement Added: Storage backup

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=saveload]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The backup is a safety measure in case the main storage file is corrupted or deleted by accident.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Sort command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Debt collectors would want to sort their contacts in various ways for easier viewing.

==== Implementation

---

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Cluster field

==== External behaviour

`Clusters` are generated based on based on https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/resources/misc/list_of_postal_districts.htm[postal districts].

==== Justification

An easy way to group contacts is needed for a debt collector to better plan his/her trips.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=cluster]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Nearby command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=nearby]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Debt collectors may want to see details of nearby contacts to plan a more effective visiting schedule

=== Enhancement Added: Making index optional for commands

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide] written by Jelena Neo Hui Ling#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=borrow]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Calling commands directly on the currently selected person makes much more intuitive sense than always supplying an
`INDEX` each time. This also increases the flexibility and convenience of Codii.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=optionalIndex]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Switching themes

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The ability to change themes can make the user feel more as though the app belongs to him/her as it is a form of
customisation. It allows for a much better user experience.

==== Implementation
