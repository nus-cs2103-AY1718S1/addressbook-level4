== Project: Codii
[https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main[Codii]] is a desktop address book application specially designed for debt collectors to manage debtors in a simple manner. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Debt collectors can store information such as the amount owed, debt borrow date and debt cleared date in addition to debtor’s personal information.

Unique features such as an interest calculator help debt collectors manage debts more efficiently.

Codii is evolved from [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4]] which is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=saveload]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The backup is a safety measure in case the main storage file is corrupted or deleted by accident.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Sort command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Implementation

---

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Cluster field

==== External behaviour

`Clusters` are generated based on based on [https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/resources/misc/list_of_postal_districts.htm[postal districts]].

==== Justification

An easy way to group contacts is needed for a debt collector to better plan his/her trips.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=cluster]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Nearby command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=nearby]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Debt collectors may want to see details of nearby contacts to plan a more effective visiting schedule

=== Enhancement Added: Making index optional for commands

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=borrow]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Calling commands directly on the currently selected person makes much more intuitive sense than always supplying an
`INDEX` each time. This also increases the flexibility and convenience of Codii.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=optionalIndex]

#End of Extract#
