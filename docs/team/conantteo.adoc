=== Enhancement Added: vCard Export

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This feature is implemented to allow users to export their contacts information into a commonly used contacts file,
vCard file. vCard file is also widely used in many platforms where people can share contacts information. Users can also
decide if they want to export all contacts or only selected contacts depending on their needs. Therefore, this feature
aims to provide the convenience for users who wish to easily export their contacts from HitMeUp to another platform.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Email

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=email]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This feature is implemented to allow users to send an email to one or more persons in their list of contacts.
It allows users to customize their own message with editing tools using their own mail application. In addition, this
feature also allows user to easily attach documents to send to their contacts or save their message as a draft in their
email. Hence, this feature helps to create a channel for communication between the users and people in their list of
contacts.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Auto-completion

==== External behavior

---

As user enters their command by pressing in partial words, they can view a list of suggestions in a drop down menu.
Using the up/down arrow keys to select the desired suggestion and press enter will complete the command for them.

---

==== Justification

For commands that are frequently used, an auto-completion will help users to save time and effort in typing the entire
command. Auto-completion will filter a list of commonly used commands so that users do not have to repeatedly type the
same command. Hence, this feature will help to make HitMeUp for user-friendly.

==== Implementation

---

Firstly, there will be auto-complete text field that extends from the command box. There will be a maximum of 8
auto-complete suggestions that are stored. Each time a user enters a command, there will be a count to suggest how often
the command has been used.

Next, as user enters a few letters into the command box, the drop down menu will match the string with an existing
sorted set of frequently used commands. Once matched, the drop down menu will show these suggestions to the user. If the
user wish to use the suggestion, he/she can simply hit enter so that the command box text property will be filled with
the suggestion command.
