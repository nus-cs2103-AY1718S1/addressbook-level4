=== Enhancement Added: Temporary residents

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=temporaryperson]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Hostel managers often welcome visitors or guests that may not stay for the entire duration of the semester. Making a resident
 temporary would automatically allow ResidentBook to delete the resident's details after the preset time. This not only saves space
 in the ResidentBook, but also saves the hassle of looking through a long list of residents to find the guest to delete.

=== Enhancement Added: Add command deletebytag

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletebytag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
Tags are useful when they are assigned to a person or a group of people for identification purpose.
When we want to remove all people who have been assigned a certain tag, this command comes in handy.

For example, at the start of the year, the hostel administrator added Y4 students and gave them the tag "graduating".
Now at the end of the year after they have graduated, the hostel administrator wants to remove all of them from the
ResidentBook. This command serves this purpose, and many more similar scenarios.

=== Enhancement Added: Add Calendar Interface and Commands

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=Calendar]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
Since events management is a great feature of ResidentBook, it would be natural to add a calendar
to view the events. Furthermore with more events being added, viewing events in a list makes it hard to see the relative
dates that the events are taking place. This feature aims to solve that problem.
