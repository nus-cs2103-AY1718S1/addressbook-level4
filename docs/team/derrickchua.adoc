=== Enhancement Added: Sync

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sync]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

People use their smartphones mainly to access their contacts,
and adding synchronisation with Google Contacts provides a way
for the modern user to use the ABC Business Contacts application
without the hassle of importing and exporting his contacts
constantly.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sync]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Add command `note`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=note]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Adding a `note` command enables the user to add notes for his contacts quickly should he need
to jot something down.

=== Enhancement Added: Optional fields for `add`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Not all details are always known about a contact, but it should not prevent
a user from adding him/her.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add different views for Meetings
