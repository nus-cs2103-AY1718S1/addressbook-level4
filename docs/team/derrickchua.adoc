== Project: ABC Business Contacts
ABC Business Contact(ABC) is a free and open-source desktop Business Contact Management application that allows the user to store a local database of contacts, and track their appointments. There are a wide variety of commands to optimise organisation and management of a user's contact information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

=== Enhancement Added: Sync

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sync]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

People use their smartphones mainly to access their contacts,
and adding synchronisation with Google Contacts provides a way
for the modern user to use the ABC Business Contacts application
without the hassle of importing and exporting his contacts
constantly.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sync]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Add command `note`
==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=note]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Adding a `note` command enables the user to add notes for his contacts quickly should he need
to jot something down.

=== Enhancement Added: Optional fields for `add`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Not all details are always known about a contact, but it should not prevent
a user from adding him/her.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add different views for Meetings

A command `view` is added, where the user can specify how he wants to view his meetings, i.e. by week, month or year

==== Justification

Users should be able to categorise their contacts by period, i.e. week, month or year
