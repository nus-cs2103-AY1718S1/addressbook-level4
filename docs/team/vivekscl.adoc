== Project:  UniCity
UniCity is a desktop address book application used to help university students manage their ever-growing network.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 16 kLoC (16 000 Lines of Code).

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W13-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/vivekscl.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W13-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/vivekscl.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Adding/Removing Tags

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=addremove]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Before the addition of this enhancement, the only way to add more tags was to manually edit each person and enter an
entirely new list of tags. Due to this high level of inconvenience, a specific command to add and remove tags was
required.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=addremovetag]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Suggestion Feature for Find Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The find command previously showed results only for names that are found in UniCity. However, when a mistake is made,
neither are any results shown nor is a suggestion made for the user to realise his mistake. This leaves the user
confused and thus this enhancement was required. With this enhancement, the user is guided towards finding the
result he is looking for.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Changing of Window Size

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=windowsize]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The target users are university students who are able to type fast and prefer that method of entering commands. As
such there is a need in having a command to change window size instead of manually dragging the corners.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=windowsize]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Autocomplete feature through analysis of command history

Over time, the user may type repeated commands, as such an autocomplete feature would be convenient for the user.
After the user closes UniCity the command history which usually becomes empty, will be stored instead. With the memory
of the command history, an analysis can be done and suggestions as a drop down menu can be made when the user types
similar commands. As suggested in the forum issue https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/forum/issues/122[#122],
the ControlFX library in JavaFX will prove useful in implementing this feature.
