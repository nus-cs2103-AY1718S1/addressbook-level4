== Purpose

This Project Portfolio Page introduces the software, The Myth's Book, and subsequently displays the contributions that Chan Kin Hung Dickson
done for The Myth's Book. The contributions include enhancements added, enhancements proposed, and other additional contributions.

== Project: The Myth's Book
The Myth's Book is an address book dedicated for university students to store useful information such
as websites, phone numbers and emails of the people around them for personal usage. The application helps students
to keep track of birthday dates and upcoming events through a calendar and facilitate convenient access to their friend's website
and even Google Maps location through the in-built browser panel in the application. Furthermore, there are many
useful tools such as finding group tags (e.g. friends, neighbours) and switching themes for better user preference and usability.

The Myth's Book is a `Command Line Input` based software which helps caters to students who are efficient and comfortable
in typing out command line inputs to manipulate with information of their contacts in the address book.
The Myth's Book is a software application that is coded in `Java` programming language.

The figure below is the start page of The Myth's Book.
