== Project: Planno
Planno is a desktop application which combines the functionality of an address book and a task manager. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

=== Enhancement Added: selectE command

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

The current design of Planno allows the users to see the person list on the left and the event list on the right.
However, the user will not be able to see which events a person has joined unless he/she uses the join, showP or display command to check each event individually.
This process is tedious for the user.
This is why the selectE command was added, to ensure that the user will be able to find such information quickly and easily. +

The event list is filtered so the user will not be distracted by other events which are not related to their query.
E.g. selectE 1, event list only displayed events joined by the person at the first index.

=== Enhancement Added: toggle

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

==== Justification

As Planno is not capable sending emails with a command, the in-app browser is used instead if the user wants to send emails.
However, the amount of space to display the browser alongside the other information boards is limited.
If everything was displayed at the same time, Planno will look very cluttered and messy.
This is why the toggle command is added.
The user can switch between the browser and information boards as and when they need.
Allowing the user to have a comfortable experience using the app while not sacrificing the functionality. +

The toggling of the browser affects the information board and event list.
The latter two are chosen to be swapped with the browser to allow the user a comfortable experience with the browser while not making Planno just a browser.
Swapping just the information board will have the browser be too small for the user to use comfortably.
Swapping the person list, information board and event list will have Planno become a browser instead of an addressbook and task manager application.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `email`

{Explain similar to the Undo/Redo feature above.}
