== Project: Sales Navigator
Sales Navigator is a desktop application built to alleviate the hassles that sales executives experience. The user
interacts with it using a CLI (Command Line Interface), and it has a GUI created with Java FX. It is written using
Java and was built by modifying an existing project, Address Book Level 4.

=== Enhancement Added: Aliases

==== External behavior

---
The aliases/synonyms are added for all commands available in [v1.5] in the user guide.

==== Justification

---
This feature allows more flexibility to the user instead of having to remember specific command names.
The user can choose to use a different command name whenever they want.
This especially useful for users who, needs to type fast, are lazy or forgetful, they can choose to use shorter
command names which takes slightly lesser time.

*Instead of typing the command _add_, the user can type _a_.*

=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

==== Justification

---
This feature is essential for the Sales Navigator as it allows the user to view his/her person list with ease by
arranging/sorting the list by different ways. It is required as this function allows the user to sort the person
list by name, tag, company, position and the priority. Sorting by priority is one of the way the user can sort.

The implementation is done creating different comparators to sort in the different ways. Sorting by company, priority and
position requires specific ways to be sorted. Therefore, a custom comparator would be needed to sort the list in a
way that is most suited for the user.

*After sorting by _Priority_, user decides to sort by _Name_*

=== Enhancement Added: Setting Relationship

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=setrelationship]

==== Justification

---
This feature is essential for the Sales Navigator as it lets the user make connection or set-up relationship among
his/her clients. As a sales executive, the user may come across situations where the clients are related to one
another. The connection/relationship may be siblings, colleagues, etc. Therefore, this enhancement allows the user to
set the connections among his/her clients.

The implementation is done very similarly to how the field *Tag* is created. The key differences between them is
that the adding, deleting and clearing of relationships are not allowed to be executed in the *Add* and *Edit*
command.

=== Enhancement Proposed:

** Enhance Set Relationship command to be able to edit relationship between two persons.
** Enhance Delete Command to be able to delete all the corresponding relationship that person has with other people,
so that when one person is being deleted all relationships other person has with him/her will be deleted.
** Add specific relationship groups that group specific relationships together to enable easier viewing
 for user when the person card is selected.
