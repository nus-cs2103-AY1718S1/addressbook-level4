== Project: Sales Navigator
Sales Navigator is a desktop application built to alleviate the hassles that sales executives experience. The user
interacts with it using a CLI (Command Line Interface), and it has a GUI created with Java FX. It is written using
Java and was built by modifying an existing project, Address Book Level 4.

=== Enhancement Added: Aliases

==== External behavior

---
The aliases/synonyms are added for all commands available in [v1.5] in the user guide.

==== Justification

---
This feature allows more flexibility to the user instead of having to remember specific command names.
The user can choose to use a different command name whenever they want.
This especially useful for users who, needs to type fast, are lazy or forgetful, they can choose to use shorter
command names which takes slightly lesser time.

*Instead of typing the command _add_, the user can type _a_.*

=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

==== Justification

---
This feature is essential for the Sales Navigator as it allows the user to view his/her person list with ease by
arranging/sorting the list by different ways. It is required as this functional allows the user to sort the priority
of his/her clients so that the user will know which client(s) is of a higher priority etc. Sorting by priority is one
of the way the user can sort.

The implementation is done creating different comparators to sort in the different ways. Sorting by priority and
status requires specific ways to be sorted. Therefore a custom comparator would e needed to sort and display the list
in a way that is most suited for the user.

*Before sorting by _Priority_*

*After sorting by _Priority_*

*After sorting by _Priority_, user decides to sort by _Name_*

=== Enhancement Added: Setting Relationship

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=setrelationship]

==== Justification

---
This feature is essential for the Sales Navigator as it lets the user make connection or set-up relationship among
his/her clients. As a sales executive, the user may come across situations where the clients are related to one
another. The connection/relationship may be siblings, colleagues, etc. Therefore, this enhancement allows the user to
set connections among his/her clients.

The implementation is done very similarly to have the field *Tag* is created. The key differences between them is
them is that adding, deleting and clearing of relationships are not allowed to be executed in the *Add* and *Edit*
command.
