Hi, I am Eng Sheng. Welcome to my project portfolio. I am currently a year 2 student studying Computer Science at NUS. This is one of the few projects that I have done in the university. I had previously worked on larger scale projects as an intern at a private sector company, [http://www.tunitytech.com/[TunityTechnologies]] and at a government sector as well, at [https://www.sla.gov.sg/[Singapore Land Authority]]. I have also done User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with clients from National Gallery Singapore.

If you have any questions or would like to contact me, you can reach me at e0032165@u.nus.edu.

This is a school project that I have done. It is called "Unify". It is a Command Line Interface AddressBook that helps you manage your contacts efficiently. Unlike conventional Address Books, Unify adopts a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
With just one line, you can traverse your large network to find your old pal John or update your Brotherâ€™s phone number. Now you can spend less time in your Address Book, and more time on what matters most to you.

It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

It is important to give users a way to share their contacts in their address book with another person. Hence, the `share` command helps the user to easily share one of their contact in their address book to another person through email.

This is extremely useful when a friend of yours has changed his/her phone number or address, and since you have the latest details about him/her, you can easily share his/her contact to your mutual friends easily.

Most of us enjoy listening to music while we work. Hence, by having a built-in music player, users can enjoy some tunes while they adding, or editing or any other related task in Unify address book.

You may ask, "Why can't I use other streaming services such as Spotify?" Well, the reason is that this does not require an Internet connection, and since it is already built-in, it encourages users to use it immediately
without any second thought. Users would prefer this method as it removes the hassle of requiring multiple clicks to find a music to play. Instead, it only requires a single `music play` command to play some music.

Some users prefer to hear more than a couple of songs that Unify's music player could offer, hence radio streaming is a good alternative for users who have Internet connection.

In addition, this radio player has a radio channel for "news", which gives users some information about current news, weather or even sales promotion.
This allows users to share good sales promotions that were broadcasted over the radio channel with their friends as they can immediately contact their friends through using Unify. Users can also hear weather forecast from the radio broadcast and plan their activities carefully to avoid the stormy weather.

Since the radio player is already built-in, it encourages users to use it immediately without any second thought. Users would prefer this method as it removes the hassle of requiring multiple clicks to find a radio station broadcast to play. Instead, it only requires a single `radio play` command to play some radio broadcast over the Internet.

It is very important to give the user some form of feedback other than visual feedback. Minor audio cues can make a tremendous difference in user experience.

I want the users to feel that they are in control, hence I have added the typing sound that gives the user the sense of every input they make is being inputted successfully, every character, every key press is essential.

The next audio cue I have added is the Text-To-Speech feature, specifically, this feature allows Unify to "speak" to the user. Giving a more human-like feedback to the user.
When a command is executed successfully Unify will announce that it is executed successfully. In addition, when the user selects a contact's name, Unify will say out the name of the selected contact's name.

This Text-To-Speech feature was part of the initiative together with the (not yet implemented) Speech-To-Text feature to bring in users who have vision disabilities into using Unify as well. Potentially increasing our user base.

Instead of separating remarks into another command. I have decided to implement it together with `add` and `edit` command instead. This streamlines the process of adding and editing a remark. Even though this involves editing existing code base, I believe the outcome is much better than having remarks as a separate command.

Sometimes, users want another form of input. By having Speech-To-Text features implemented into Unify, we are able to give users another form of input.

This feature could be also extremely beneficial to users that suffer from slow typing or prefer to multitask
and use their speech to execute commands instead. This feature may be also tied together with the existing Text-To-Speech feature to help users who may suffer from some form of disabilities, to give them a hands-free yet full user experience of Unify without any drawbacks.

I have tried experimenting with some Speech-To-Text codes, but I do not enough time for it to be implemented in the final product of V1.5 of Unify.

The codes can be here [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B4/main/blob/master/collated/unused/hanselblack.md[Unused code]] while the resource files can be found here [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B4/main/tree/master/unused/resources/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us[Resources]]

* Created template for the step-by-step screenshot layout design for the User Guide. (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B4/main/pull/74/commits/d3724bd9bd95a51cf9821906166835419259f050[#74])
* Designed the User Guide to make it user-friendly and appealing. In addition, I had also made every image used in User Guide, except for the other developers' screenshots for their respective features. (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B4/main/pull/62[#62])
* Made screenshots of the user interface, that are found in the UserGuide and ensured that these screenshots reflect the latest version of Unify application. In addition, I had also written the step-by-step instructions for all existing commands from AddressBook level 4.
