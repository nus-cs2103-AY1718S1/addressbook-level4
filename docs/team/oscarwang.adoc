== LISA: Levels Integrated Secretarial Agent
LISA: Levels Integrated Secretarial Agent is a desktop address book application designed for insurance agents to manage the complex relationship between the providers and clients.
While the main user interactions happen across CLI, it also has a GUI built with JavaFX.
LISA is developed by enhancing the original program "addressbook-level4" provided in class for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The original program is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

As a user, I can add contacts even if I only know his/her name.
In reality, it is unreasonable to require users to provide complete information of a person when adding his/her as a contact.
