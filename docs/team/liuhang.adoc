When a `pref` command is entered, the `PrefCommand` will attempt to find and execute `get<PreferenceKey>`
method in the `UserPrefs` class using Java Reflection API. If an exception is encountered, it is assumed that the method
does not exist and the preference key entered by the user was invalid. Similarly, if two arguments were entered, `PrefCommand`
will again try to find and execute `set<PreferenceKey>` method.
