In addition to configuration, user can customize the address book application by editing preferences. The difference between
configurations and preferences is that configuration stores basic information requried to start the application, while
preferences determine high level functionalities and UI styles.

#End of Extract#

User can change the value of a preference by entering `pref PREFERENCE_KEY NEW_PREFERENCE_VALUE`.

When a `pref` command is entered, the `PrefCommand` will attempt to find and execute `get<PreferenceKey>`
method in the `UserPrefs` class using Java Reflection API. If an exception is encountered, it is assumed that the method
does not exist and the preference key entered by the user was invalid. Similarly, if two arguments were entered, `PrefCommand`
will again try to find and execute `set<PreferenceKey>` method.
