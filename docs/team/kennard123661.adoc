== Project: Ark
Ark is a desktop delivery management application that my team and I had built for our Software Engineering module in the
National University of Singapore. We built this application for delivery companies to manage their deliveries.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 14kLoC.
 You may access the Ark repository link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B1/main[here].

Ark was built on top of link::https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4[Addressbook - Level 4], an
addressbook application. A number of features were added and refactoring was done to develop the original codebase
into the parcel management application, Ark.

You may access the links below for a list of more significant contributions I have made to Ark. Functional code
refers to the code that I have written to enhance the Ark application while Test code refers to the code that I have written
to automate testing for the Ark application.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/kennard123661.md[Functional code]][https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/kennard123661.md[Test code]]

The following are my contributions to the project explained in detail:

=== Enhancement Added: Import Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=import]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Parcel companies manage millions of deliveries on a daily basis. As such, they have to deal with large amounts of
data and deliveries. Furthermore, adding parcels into Ark individually is time consuming. Hence, I built a
feature that allows parcel companies to import parcels from storage files, and add parcels into Ark more efficiently.

Moreover, parcels are usually passed from one delivery company to another (or to another shipping company). Hence, I
wanted to make it possible for delivery companies to be able to transfer their Ark storage files to each other as they
transfer stewardship of parcels. This would save delivery companies time since they do not need to re-enter data that
the previous delivery company had already entered.

I designed this feature to accept `.xml` only files since Ark stores its files in `.xml` format and I wanted the
 import command to be compatible with its storage files so that it can import its storage files.

=== Enhancement Added: Backup Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Delivery information is very important to delivery companies. Since it is impossible to prevent corruption of storage files,
I developed an alternative measure, a feature that automatically backs up a reasonable recent version of the corrupted
save file.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Status Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=status]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Parcels can be in several stages of a delivery process. They can be pending delivery, or being delivered at a
particular instance. Hence, it is imperative that delivery companies are able to assign a status to their parcels to
have a clear idea of the stage of delivery that their parcels are at. Moreover, it allows delivery customers to be
accountable to their clients when their clients inquire about the delivery status of their parcels.

In addition, this feature has an automatic `Status` update base on the delivery date of the parcel. If the delivery date has
 been passed, the parcel `Status` updates to `OVERDUE`. Otherwise, it will update to `PENDING`. This update only works
 for parcels that have `PENDING` or `OVERDUE` `Status`. The automatic update feature allows our users to have a more
 intuitive description of the urgency of a parcel delivery. Rather than observing the date to determine if the parcel is
 overdue, Ark's `Status` feature, with its automatic updates helps users visualize this information more intuitively.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=status]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Tracking Number Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=trackingNumber]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Delivery companies use tracking numbers to track their parcels in their possession. Tracking numbers are necessary since
a single person can have many different items that are meant to delivered to him on a single day. Tracking numbers help
our users and their clients differentiate between these parcels. This helps our users become more accountable to clients
if a certain parcel has not been delivered as well.

==== Implementation

---

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=trackingNumber]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Postal Code Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=postalCode]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Addresses in Singapore have a postal code representation. We use this postal code feature to query Google Maps on the
destination address of a parcel and help our users visualize this information. This feature is necessary because
addresses in Singapore can have similar names (Type OCBC into Google Maps, and you will observe that OCBC has many
branches) around Singapore. Hence, postal codes will help Google Maps pinpoint the exact address that we should deliver
a parcel too. Furthermore, postal codes are short and succinct and do not require an extensive amount of effort for
the user to input this data.

==== Implementation

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=postalCode]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Tag Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tags]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

More often than not, different parcels require different types of handling. The Tag feature is used to help users tag
parcels with tags to describe how the parcel needs to be handled. This information helps to ensure that proper handling
precautions are taken while handling a parcel and ensures that it reaches its intended recipient safely.

==== Implementation

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=tags]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Tooltip Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tooltip]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

There are occasions where inputs to Ark are really long. To ensure that our users will be able to see the full input
in Ark, a tooltip is added to help our users visualize this elongated data as observed in the diagram above.

---

=== Enhancement Added: Gui Tab Feature

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=gui-tab]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users can use this feature to segment the work (parcels) that have completed and the parcels they have to yet to deliver.
This helps users to differentiate between the tasks they have completed and tasks that they have to do. By organising this
data into separate lists, we can help users to visualize information about their parcels more intuitively without
having a clunky interface.

=== Documentation Contributions

Here are some of the more significant segments of documentation that I've written for the Ark project.

**Here are some enhancements that I have proposed for my team's project:**

=== Enhancement Proposed: Clustering of Parcel Deliveries

Cluster parcels with `Delivering` Status according to their address locations to ensure that deliveries in a single
cluster are delivered together.

== Other Project: NUSVisions

NUSVisions was an application I built over the Summer of 2017. NUSVisions is an application meant to help NUS students
plan for the entire 4 years of their studies. It stores your sessions to ensure that modules saved in your plans remain
after a period of time. I deployed the web application on a Heroku server and you can access it by clicking
