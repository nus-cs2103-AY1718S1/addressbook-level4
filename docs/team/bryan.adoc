== Introduction
Hello. My name is Bryan Koh, and I am a year 2 Computer Science student at National University of Singapore. This portfolio is designed to outline my software development project experiences to supplement my resume. If you are interested in contacting me for possible collaborations, do drop me an email at kohwxb@u.nus.edu. Thank you for taking some time off to read my works.

== Project: Augustine
Augustine is a desktop address book application that aims to help students to manage the contacts of their newly made friends in school. It is a project for my CS2103T module which builds on an existing desktop address book application, https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4[addressbook-level4].

The user interacts with Augustine using a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is developed in Java and runs in both Windows and Unix environment.

=== Augustine Enhancement: Find Command

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

=== Justification For Enhancing Find Command

The original find command only allows full name search of contacts. There was a need for users to be able to search by contactâ€™s tag and name for more control for the search. Also, case insensitive and non-full word search have been added to give users more flexibility over the search results of find command.

A simple sort feature was also incorporated into the find command which gives users the option to sort the search results by name, tag, email or address.

These enhancements provide users with more flexibility and control over the find command to search for contacts in Augustine.

=== Augustine Enhancement: Email Command

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=email]

=== Justification for Enhancing Email Command

There was a lack of communication means between user and their contacts. Since email address are a compulsory field in Augustine, the user will be able to contact all contacts in Augustine via email. Hence, the email command was added into Augustine.
