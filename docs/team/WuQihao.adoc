=== Enhancement Added: Delete by name

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletebyname]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

It is troublesome for users to refer to the list constantly, trying to find the corresponding index of the person in order to delete him/her from the list. +
Users are able to delete anyone from the list as long as he/she could remember the name, even a part fo the name.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=deletebyname]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users with a large number of contacts in the list will often have trouble organising them. +
Sort command allows users to organise contacts easily, contacts are more accessible, and hence increase productivity.

=== Enhancement Added: Export

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

There is no way for users to backup address book before export command is implemented. +
It is a solution to potential data losses and lays a foundation for my proposed import command.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Export to cloud storage

With an initial modification of the current `export` command which increases the number of supporting file type, an integration with cloud storage service would be beneficial for users. +
It further decreases the risk of data loses and provides the possibility of cross-platform integration.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `import`

A command that allows users to import address book with all `export` command's supporting file format. +
Both local and cloud import makes AcquaiNote more user friendly and would greatly increase users' productivity.
