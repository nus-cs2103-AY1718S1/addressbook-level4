== Project: The Classroom
The Classroom is a desktop application that helps users manage their contacts and keep track of tasks or remarks that pertain to specific contacts.
It is especially helpful in helping students manage and increase the efficiency of their group work. +
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 8 kLoC. +
The Classroom is built up from the [https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4]] (an address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles)

The purpose of this portfolio is to highlight the changes that I made to improve the application from the basic address book
application and why the enhancements were made, along with how they were implemented.

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Since our target users are students that do a lot of group work (or people that work with different people frequently),
we wanted to include a function that allows the user to save remarks on task that want to do with other people, or
things they want to make sure other people do. +
So having a remark checklist helps the user keep track of things they need to do
with different people.

=== Enhancement Added: Link Command
Allow user to add a twitter link to a person in the contact that loads when target person is selected

==== External behaviour

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::..\UserGuide.adoc[tag=link]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

With a twitter page linked to a person in the contact, the user will be able to determine exactly who is in his contact,
even if he/she have multiple contact of the same name. +
On top of this, they would be able to take advantage of the twitter
messaging feature to handle discussions without leaving the application.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::..\DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=link]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Private/ public accounts
Allow user to have a private contact list that is protected by login username and password. +
Having an account would allow us to save any application information to be used on other computers or platforms if required.
