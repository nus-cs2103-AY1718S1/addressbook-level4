*Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] {give links to collated code files}

=== Enhancements Added: Sorting Contacts by Name, Finding Contacts by Tag, Email Command

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sortByName]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=findtag]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=emailCommand]

---

==== Justification

*Listing all persons:* +
There is a need to have the contacts sorted by default as this would allow users to be able to look through
a more organized contact list by default, rather than one without order.

*Locating persons by their tag:* +
This is necessary for better organization as it will reduce the time users need to spend scrolling through
the entire list to look for contacts from a particular social group. This adds on to the convenient factor
of the application.

*Emailing a person:* +
This command allows users to be able to email their contacts hassle-free as they do not need to open their
email, compose a new email and copy their contact's email inside. Instead, after typing in the command line,
the default mail app will appear with the email of the contact already inside.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=emailMech]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add Subject and more emails via command line

This will make it more convenient to email multiple people at once.
