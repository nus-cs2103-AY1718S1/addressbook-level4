==== Justification

Bookmarking was a key feature part of the user story, as the tourist would like to track favourite places.
Implementation was done via tag manipulation since the Tag class was well suited to support this feature. However,
tag  manipulation was cumbersome in the old addressbook, only from the edit command which was very slow.

My solution has seperate commands to speed up the process of adding/removing a specific tag ("Bookmarked") from each place, by passing
the need to use the slower edit command.

=== Enhancement Added: Direction from place to place

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=direction]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Highlighted as a "nice to have" feature in the user story. The usage would be the tourist has a schedule to visit
several places in a day. It is very likely the tourist would seek direction to get from one listed place to another listed
place.

"dir" command is implemented as a shortcut to manually entering 2 places on Google maps. It uses the name and postal
code data found in the Tourist-Book to help the tourist search for the direction in the browser panel.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add place attribute : "Description"

Currently, there isn't a short summary on what the various places offer, the tourist would need to select a place and visit
the its website to find out more. However, the website might load slowly, and would require a few mouse clicks
to find what is the place about.

To alleviate this issue, we can pre-load the description into a new place attribute<optional> and have it display
on the place list.
