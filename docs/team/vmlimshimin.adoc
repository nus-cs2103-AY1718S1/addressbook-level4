=== 1st Enhancement Added: Recently Deleted

==== External behavior for 1st Enhancement

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=recentlydeleted]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification for 1st Enhancement

When a huge amount of contacts are deleted at one shot, via the `DeleteMultipleCommand`, `RecentlyDeletedCommand` allows the user to sift through the list of previously deleted contacts and extract the ones that the user wants to add back into TheYellowPage. This is so that the user does not need to undo the `DeleteMultipleCommand` (which will retrieve all the deleted contacts) to retrieve just one or a few contacts that were accidentally deleted.
