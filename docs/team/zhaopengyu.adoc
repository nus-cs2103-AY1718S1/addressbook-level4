==== Justification

The need for recycle bin commands:

It is more convenient for users to find back a person they wrongly delete before instead of readding the person again. The undo/redo command can only acheive the same functionality when the delete command is conducted after the last exiting of application. However, if the delete command is conducted long time ago or before last exiting of application, it is hard or impossible for users to find the wrongly deleted person back. Therefore, we need a recycle bin to store all the perosn delted by user to facilitating restoring.
