== Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to help me keep track of progress I made for each project. This will be able to help me learn as I progress to another project. For now, it will help me keep track of `ConnectUs` project for me.  This portfolio marks the start of my first portfolio and I aim to increase the content as I develop more applications.

== Project: ConnectUs
ConnectUs is a desktop address book application used to store contact information such as name, phone, email and address.
The user can tag entries for more efficient search and can open up an email client to send an email. The GUI displays the list of contacts as well as additional information
such as his/her address on Google Maps. The user interacts with it using a CLI, although there are additional GUI elements created in JavaFX such as a form to edit contacts, and a QR generator for you to scan
the contact's number and automatically port it to your smartphone. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

=== Enhancement Added: LoggingCommand/ClearLog

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=connectuslog]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
The LoggingCommand feature was implemented to ensure that user are still able to check the actions they executed. Only important actions such as "Add" , "Clear" , "Edit" , "Select" . etc. are recorded to the ConnectUsLog.txt file. This allow the user to have chance to check for mistakes or accidental removal of contact after realising it was a mistake committed weeks ago. +
Since there is ConnectUsLog.txt involved , user can also have the option to clear the file in order to make their records more neat compared to needing to browse through huge number of record which was confirmed unnecessary. +

=== Enhancement Added: QR(Quick Response) code generation for Calling

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=qrcall]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The QRCall feature was implemented to reduce chance of human error and time when the user wants to make call to specific contact. With the help of Quick Response Code (QR Code), the user just need to use their smartphone to scan the code which will instruct the phone on what to do. This helps save time and chance for error during the time when the user needs to make a call. +

=== Enhancement Proposed: Addition of Voice Command with Google Voice Recognition `Coming in v2.0`

As most of the features that i implemented are targeted at user convenience. The proposed suggestion will help make the application more easy to use with just commanding the application on what to do while you can multitask with other task you are busy with.
