ConTag is an efficient and feature-packed desktop address book application for the most demanding business users and busiest frequent travellers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

=== Enhancement Added: Expansion of Existing Help Function

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=help]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

ConTag supports various commands with different command formats. This makes it difficult for new users to remember how each command is used. Displaying the format of a specific command will save users the trouble to go through the user guide repeatedly. This enhancement serves as a quick reminder for the users, catered especially towards new users.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=help]

#End of Extract#
