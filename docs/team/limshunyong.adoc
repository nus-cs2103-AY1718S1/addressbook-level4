=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Sorting enables the user to list all its contact details in an organised manner. This allows the
user to identify a particular contact details based on its name in a quicker manner.

Currently, the user simply needs to type the command `sort` in the command line interface and the application
will automatically sort the address book based on the name of the contacts.

The sorting make use of self-defined java comparator that compare against the name of the objects in the `ReadOnlyPerson` list.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `import`

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=import]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification


As the application is targeted to business professionals, we wanted them to be able to retrieve his or her list of contact details from other sources to our application
easily.

So instead of having to add in the contact details one by one, we implemented the import function to allow the user to import all the contact details from his or her external sources to our application with just a single command.

We chose vCard for our import sources because it is supported by other application such as the contact list from the user's mobile application as well as more common web or desktop applications such as Google contacts or Apple contacts.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Added Command `export`

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification


As a business professionals, it is important to be able to backup all the contact details that one may have expecially the more important ones such as your business partner.

Therefore our applications allows the user to export all his or her contact details from our application into a vCard so that the user will be able to backup all the details into a secondary addressbook application
so that in the event of experiencing a downtime from our application, the user can still retrieve his or her contact details from the secondry application.
