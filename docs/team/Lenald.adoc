== Introduction
In this project portfolio, the `external` and `internal` behavior of the various features of `cherBook`, along with the `motivations`
behind implementing them, will be explained thoroughly.

`cherBook` is an address book application that combines `statistical analysis` with the ease of `communication`.
It is targeted at `teachers` as it offers various features that can improve their lives.

The user can interact with it using a `command line interface`, and it has a `graphical user interface` created with `JavaFX`.
The application is written in `Java`.

=== Enhancement Added: Randomised Unique Tag Colors

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=randomisedUniqueTagColors]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

In this day and age, educators have many classes of students to teach. They will have difficulty differentiating between
tags of different descriptions, if they are to tag many of their students.

This feature will assign tags of the same descriptions with a unique color. With the implementation of this feature,
 educators will be able to distinguish between the different tags easily.

=== Enhancement Added: Optional Inputs/Fields

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=optionalinputtagstwo]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

As we increased the number of attributes for the person who is being added into the address book, we realised that it is getting very cumbersome for the user to
input all the compulsory attributes into cherBook. Furthermore, the person to be added might not have all the attributes deemed compulsory.


Thus, we decided that several non essential attributes can
be optional inputs for the user.

=== Removed Enhancement: Multiple Numbers (Parent and Student number)

==== External behavior

---

Note that this is not an extract from the userguide as this particular section is removed from the userguide.

=== Adding multiple numbers to a person: `add` `Since v1.3`

[NOTE]
====
Adding of student or/and parent's number must be preceded by the phone prefix `p/`. +
Input of `student phone number` is optional. +
Fields that enclosed in `square brackets` are optional fields.
====

You can add `multiple numbers` to a person by adhering to the format below. +

Format: add n/NAME `p/student/ STUDENTNUMBER parent/ PARENTNUMBER` [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] f/FORMCLASS g/GRADES [c/POSTALCODE] [t/TAG]... +
Shorthand: a n/NAME `p/student/ STUDENTNUMBER parent/ PARENTNUMBER` [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] f/FORMCLASS g/GRADES [c/POSTALCODE] [t/TAG]...

Example:

* add n/Alex Yeoh `p/student/97272031 parent/97979797` e/alexyeoh@example.com a/Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40 f/6E1 g/123.0

==== Justification

Initially, cherBook had the option of only being able to record the student's number.
We decided to come out with multiple numbers (Parent and Student number)
as many educators believe that there needs to be good communication between not only the students, but their parents too.

This enhancement is especially useful for those who are in charge of younger students
in primary school. Educators in institutions with younger students
will find having parents numbers more important than the student's number, as there tends to be more communication
between the teachers and the parents of the students.
