== Project: Bamboo
Bamboo is a command-line interface (CLI) based address book application. It is a one-stop solution to help you manage your contacts in an efficient and convenient manner. Using Bamboo, you can organize contacts into groups, find common schedules and get connected to your contactsâ€™ social media platforms.

==== Justification

* Having a "sort" command allows our users to list contacts in the address book in the order that they desire.
This can be useful as the user may want to view contacts in alphabetical order, or sorted by their email addresses.

* The Group System is meant to be a total overhaul and improvement over the tagging system. Tags do not show you
at a glance which other contacts share the same tags as the current one, nor are they intuitive in terms of managing contacts
as a 'group'. With the group feature, a user can see at one glance the group members in the same group and add, remove
them in a intuitive manner.

* Having a `cadd` command which pulls events from Google Calendar for a contact is useful and meaningful as people tend to keep
track of their schedule through a calendar of some sort and Google Calendar is a commonly used service.
