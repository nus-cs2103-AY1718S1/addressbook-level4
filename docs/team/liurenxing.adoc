== Project: Contact+ Pro
Contact+ Pro is a portable contact book designed specifically for NUS students with the aim to connect
the students and help them keep in touch with friends and peers!

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T14-B4/main/blob/master/collated/main/hthjthtrh.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T14-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/hthjthtrh.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Back-up storage

==== Justification

A user will lose his contacts' information if the data file is deleted or corrupted due to unforeseen circumstances.
Having a back-up storage will prevent the pain of losing all those information.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backupstorage]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Multi-step undo

==== External Behavior


---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=undo]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows user to undo multiple changes should the user only realise the mistakes steps later.

==== Implementation

This enhancement is built upon the original implementation of `undo redo mechanism`. No change is made to the underlying mechanism.
The multi-step undo is done through multiple usage of the undo mechanism. +

The following is the original mechanism:

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=undoredo]

#End of Extract#

---

==== External Behavior


---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=group]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows user to link a group of closely related contacts. Gives the user a clearer categorisation of his contacts.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=group]
