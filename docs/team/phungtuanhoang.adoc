*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/phungtuanhoang1996/main/blob/master/collated/main/Hoang.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/phungtuanhoang1996/main/blob/master/collated/test/Hoang.md[Test code]]


== Enhancement Added: Export all contacts to a `.txt` file

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

When users are on the move and do not have access to the software, it is essential to have a physical copy of all the contacts. Exporting them to a `.txt` file would faciliate the process of printing.

== Enhancement Added: Login with an email

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=emaillogin]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Justification

As the targeted users are tutors and businessmen, email functionality is required for information dissemination.

== Enhancement Added: Sending email with a logged in email

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=emailsend]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Justification

As the targeted users are tutors and businessmen, email functionality is required for information dissemination.

== Enhancement Added: Find person(s) without matching the whole keyword

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=findcontain]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Justification
* The `find` command is an OR search, therefore if users want to filter out unwanted contacts by giving more information,
an AND search (`find_contain`) will be required.
* For the search bar UI enhancement, search without matching the whole keyword is more desirable (for example: typing `ale`
will immediately show all `Alex`, thus saving time.

== Enhancement Added: User Interface overhaul

* *Dark Theme*

* *Light Theme*

== New Feature Added: Search Bar

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=searchbar]

#End of Extract#

==== Developer Guide
---

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=searchbar]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Justification

* Sometimes users need to quickly find a person and the search bar provides a quicker way than command line.

* Users sometimes forget contacts' details: for example, users call a person "Dave" but do not remember whether he saved
the contact as "David" or "Dave". Search Bar solves this problem by allowing users to just type "dav" in the name field
rather than use the `find` command twice for "dave" and "david".

== New Feature Added: Email Login window and Email Send window / Enhancement Added: Checkboxes for Contact Panel to allow sending to multiple contacts
