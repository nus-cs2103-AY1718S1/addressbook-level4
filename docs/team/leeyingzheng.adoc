=== Enhancement Added: `filter` command

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=filterbytags]

---

==== Justification

The purpose of associating contacts with tags was that users could categorize their contacts. +
While tags help to label these contacts, we feel that we can further build on the notion of categorization by showing a list of
contacts according to a specified tag(s) +
Users may want to locate a list of contacts with some purpose(s). These purpose(s) can be seen as tags and the filtering mechanism can help
locate those contacts. +

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=filterbytags]

---

=== Enhancement Added: `facebook` comand

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=facebook]


---

==== Justification

The purpose of introducing facebook command was so users can keep themselves up to date of their friends' social media posts. +
We understand that university students have social media accounts and they use it frequently for academic or social purposes. +
Since UniCity aims to connect people together, this feature will set a foundation for future enhancements that involves other social media websites
and including links to social media accounts for each contacts. +
The facebook command was initially created by me to allow users to log in and navigate through facebook;
I programmed UniCity to only show the facebook log in page when `facebook` command was typed in the early stages of development. +
Subsequently, Jiashu modified this feature by changing the behaviour of the command to allow users to search for a specified contact on Facebook. +
The facebook command now requires an additional parameter `INDEX` that searches the person of a specified contact in UniCity. +

=== Enhancement Added: `reply` command and duplicate-checking mechanism

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=reply]

---

==== Justification

Users may accidentally add a contact with duplicate fields existing in their contacts list. This may cause unnecessary confusion
when users try to differentiate among similar contacts in UniCity. Hence, we needed the mechanism to check for duplicates to address this issue.
The add and edit command will inform users if they have used a similar name, phone number, email address or home address to register a contact before.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=reply]

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `follow`

This is a refinement for the `facebook` command. By observing the implementation of `facebook` command, we can proceed to including
links to websites as one of the fields contained in a contact. It will be an optional field included by the users on `add` command.
By typing the 'follow' command, UniCity will direct its users to the website stored under the specified contact's field.

==== Justification

This purpose aligns with the `facebook` command; As UniCity strives to provide the convenience for users to access their friends' information, we can help users store
their friends' social media accounts, aside from just sorting their contacts.

==== Mechanism

A `Website` class will be introduced and like all other contact fields, it will be used by the `Person` class. This class will store a String url to the contact's profile web page.
Like all other optional fields, the default value will be "Website not added". The 'Website' class will validate the link provided by the users on `add` command by checking
with regular expressions before executing it. ++

`FollowCommand` will be the class dedicated to sending events to the `EventCenter` so the `BrowserPanel` class can handle these events to load the webpage.
Similar to 'BrowserPanel''s `loadPage` method, there will be a method to load the webpage in the contact's field.

=== Other contributions
