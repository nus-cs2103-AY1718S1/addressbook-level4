== Project: Gentleman's Guide
Gentleman's Guide is a desktop contact book application modified from the Address Book - Level 4, created by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU team].
It is designed to support business-(gentle)men in their busy work life by providing them with an effective and efficient way of managing their contacts.
Furthermore, it helps them keep track of various tasks and reminds them about the upcoming deadlines.
The interaction between user and Gentlemanâ€™s Guide is mostly done through a Command Line Interface (CLI). +
This application is written in Java, and its Graphical User Interface (GUI) is created with JavaFX.

*About Project Portfolio*: This project portfolio summarizes all new features that I have added to Gentleman's Guide, including the instructions
for users on how to use the features, the mechanism behind them, as well as the justification for implementing these features.

=== Enhancement Added: Tag/Untag/Retag commands and Retrieve command

==== Justification

Through business networking, businessmen have many opportunities to make acquaintance with people from different companies.
Therefore, they need a way to separate their contacts into smaller groups so that they can quickly access all contacts which are related to each other.

With `tag` command, users can assign tags which contain relevant information to contacts. After that, by using `retrieve` command on a certain tag,
they will be able to see all contacts that have been assigned with that tag.
In addition, `untag` and `retag` commands are implemented to give users freedom in modifying the existing tags, such as removing tags which are no longer needed and renaming an existing tag inside contact list
to reflect the changes in their relationships with the contact owners.

=== Enhancement Added: View contact profile

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=viewprofile]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

View command displays the contact on a large panel, which allows users to see all contact details in a nice
and clear way instead of having to see the details crammed inside the small cards of person list.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Proposed:

===== Custom contact fields:
In addition to original fields which are name, phone number, email, address, and tags, users will be able to specify 5
more fields according to their preferences. They can also choose which fields to display on the person card
and if they wish to see all details of the contact, they can use view command to open the contact profile.

===== LinkedIn integration:
As the target users of Gentleman's Guide are businessmen, who are most likely to have LinkedIn accounts, it will be convenient if
users can directly access the LinkedIn profiles of the contacts from inside the application without having to search for the profiles manually on the LinkedIn website.
