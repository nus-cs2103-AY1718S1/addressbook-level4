== Project: OneBook
OneBook is a desktop Address Book application. It uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but most of the interactions happen using Command Line Interface (CLI).

OneBook is optimized for companies' usage. It is also suitable for general usage.

OneBook allows users to easily import and export contacts, send emails conveniently and stores a database of contacts.

=== Enhancement Added: Recycle Bin

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=bin]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Accidentally deleting contacts can be a major problem for companies expecially if it is an important contact.
The `undo` function is sometimes not suitable for use due to reasons such as:

* Many commands to undo.
* Application has already been closed and restarted, hence clearing the undo/redo stack.

The `restore` command allows users to selectively restore deleted contacts. +
The `bindelete` and `binclear` commands allow users to manage their Recycle Bin to reduce clutter.

=== Enhancement Added: Modify UI to display contact details.

==== External behavior

New Ui

image::Ui.png[width="790"]

==== Justification

The original UI has a large amount of spaced used for a browser display panel of a Google Search of the selected contact's name. +
This does not serve much useful purpose while taking a large amount of space. +
To better make use of the space, all details except name, phone and tags of the contacts are stripped from the contact display list on the side.
The details are then only displayed when the person are selected from the list. The browser panel is also now made to display
Google Maps address of the selected contact instead.

=== Enhancement Added: Modify Storage to save `AddressBookData` instead of `ReadOnlyAddressBook` in xml format

==== External Behaviour

The storage file `addressbook.xml` holds the data of `AddressBookData`, which contains data of both the `AddressBook` and `RecycleBin`.

==== Justification

The original version of Storage only allows storage of one copy of `ReadOnlyAddressBook`. This makes it impossible to store the data
of `RecycleBin`, causing `RecycleBin` data to be lost upon closing the application.
