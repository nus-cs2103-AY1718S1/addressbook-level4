=== Enhancement Added: Backup/RestoreBackup

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backupandrestore]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may lose their original copy of saved data for many reasons. The file may be corrupted or it may have been edited accidentally.
As such, the backup and restore backup command will allow users to retrieve back their loss data.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backupandrestore]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Multiple backup files with specified path

User should be able to save different copies of backup data files as they may want to restore data from different sessions.
They should be given the choice to specify the file path to save to and the file path to restore data from.
