==== Justification

The search mechanisms are important to the address book as it allows users to find their contacts easily when they have a large amount of contacts.
Moreover, as the schedulers uses the indices to schedule, without this mechanism, the user will have to scroll through large number of the contacts to find the index of the persons they want to schedule.
With this mechanism, the user can search the common features of the people he wants to arrange such that the filtered view consists only of the persons searched and it would be more user friendly.

Sorting the address book also helps the user organise their contacts.
