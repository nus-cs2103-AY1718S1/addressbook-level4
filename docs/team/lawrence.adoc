== Project: Codii
[https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main[Codii]] is a desktop address book application specially
designed for debt collectors to manage debtors in a simple manner. It has a GUI but most of the user
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Debt collectors can store information such as the amount owed, debt borrow date and debt cleared date in addition to debtorâ€™s personal information.

Unique features such as an interest calculator help debt collectors manage debts more efficiently.

Codii is evolved from [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4]] which is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

=== Enhancement Added: Interest calculator

==== External Behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=interestCalculator]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

It would be convenient for debt collectors to have their debtors' debts updated automatically.
However, it should be noted that it is still a basic feature as it only accrues a debtor's debt at the start of each month.
An updated version will be included in V2.0.
