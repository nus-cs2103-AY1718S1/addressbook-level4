== Project: TunedIn
TunedIn is a free-to-use desktop application that brings to users the power of a
full-fledged command line personal organizer, bundled together with a user-friendly interface
and competence functions. It gives the user freedom to personalize the information in their most preferred way.
The fundamental units of this organiser are Order, Group and List mechanisms.
These primary units are the indispensable elements to build up the usability and
improving the performance of an organiser. With numerous contacts in TunedIn,
it is essential to categorise and present the wide range of information in an organised way,
at the same time, not neglecting the intuitiveness of commands for users.

=== Enhancement Added: Order
Enhanced Order command to sort with Birthday, Tag and Group, and with multiple(2) person fields.
(enhanced on the original Order command done by quanle1994)

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=order]

---

==== Justification

Ordering is essential to TunedIn. It provides the fundamental and a must-to-have functionality of an organizer.
With the ordering mechanism, user will be able to order the list of contacts in 19 different ways with more than one ordering
field.This is inline with our goal in making TunedIn as customizable as possible
and, most importantly to allow the user to organize the contacts to their most preferred way.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=order]

---

==== Enhancement Added: Group
Added Group command to group one or multiple persons in a specified group and to show the
name of existing groups.

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=group]

---

==== Justification

Grouping is another fundamental unit in any organiser application.
The function of grouping is imperative in TunedIn and allows user to
classify the contacts into different category and thus more organised.
The users are also able to specified the group name with no restriction on special characters.
Additionally, it also consists of a command “showall” which displays all the group names in the feedback box, to allow
users to check on the existing group easily and readily.
These improves the user’s experience and achieve our goal in making TunedIn easy to use.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=group]

---

==== Enhancement Added: List(group)
Enhanced List command to view a list of persons by specified group name.

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=list]

---

==== Justification

List can be used to display the entire list of contacts.
It is further enhanced to complement the function of `Group` by allowing user to
view a list of contacts by group. Instead of implementing the viewing of a group of contacts,
it is more intuitive for user to type `list` command followed by the group name. Hence, making the command
intuitive for users.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=list]
