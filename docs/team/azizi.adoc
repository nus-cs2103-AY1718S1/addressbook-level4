== Project: Bluebird
Bluebird is a desktop based organisational tool for the working parent on the go. Bluebird is suitable for a variety of
day-to-day management tasks, including managing appointments for both yourself and your child, and also organising the
contact information from your Address Book.

=== Enhancement Added: Multiple Delete

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=delete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may need to delete multiple contacts from the Bluebird application and thus, this feature will make it convenient
for the users to do so.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=delete]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Add fields individually

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may only intend to add the name and phone number field in Bluebird. Thus, with the enhanced functionality of the
add command, users can do so without any difficulty.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add multiple fields

Users may add multiple instances for any of the Person fields in Bluebird. For example, users can now add multiple
phone numbers for any of their contacts, and thus make it much more convenient for them to update their friends
particulars.
