== Project: Address++

=== Introduction
Address++ is an application that targets university students, aiming to help them manage their contacts and other aspects of their university life in an efficient manner.
Address++ is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application, where most of the commands are executed by typing rather than clicking on buttons.
Address++ also provides a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a better User Experience (UX).

This project is the result of a Software Engineering module, https://nus-cs2103.github.io/website/[CS2103T],
in NUS. Address++ is written mainly in Java, while JavaFX is used for the frontend design. Address++ is built
based on https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book (Level 4)] and the current codebase has expanded to around 10 kLoC.

=== Purpose of Project Portfolio
The purpose of this project portfolio is to showcase my contribution to the Address++, a project for the introductory Software Engineering module (CS2103T) at the National University of Singapore.
It highlights some of the key features I implemented during the course of this module and the technical details behind how these features were implemented.
It also demonstrates my ability to work with a large code base (about 10KLoC).

This is a snapshot of our User Interface

=== Enhancement Added: Add/Delete Tags

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=addtag]
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletetag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
The existing `EditCommand` has the similar functionality which is to modify the tags. However, it has two limitations.
First, it can only edit tags for one person only. Second, modified tags will replace all the original tags.
Our user, university students, often want to organize and modify their contacts in an efficient way.
To make modifying tags easier, `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` allow our users to add and delete tags for multiple persons.
They only modify the specific tags, leaving the rest tags intact.

=== Enhancement Added: Find Persons by Tags

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=findtag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
Address++ is designed as an assistant tool for university students. It aims to help users to manage their contacts in an easy way.
With the help of this command, users are able to easily find the contacts in the application. This feature allows users to easily
search for contacts in big numbers by locating them according to their tags.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=findtag]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: List Tags

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=showtag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
This enhancement is to supplement the find by tags function as described above. For users with large numbers of tags,
it may be difficult for them to remember what tags are saved in the application. This enhancement allows users to easily
refer to the tags that they have saved in the application.

==== Implementation
There are two scenarios of this feature: +
**scenario 1:** There are no tags or persons in the Address++. +
**scenario 2:** There are [TAG] [MORE TAGS]... +

==== A brief explanation of `showtag`: +
* Creates a list of tags by iterating through every Contact in the application and adding their tags to the list. +
* Check if this list of tags is empty or not. +
** If it is empty, it falls into scenario 1. Address++ will display an empty list. +
** If the list is not empty, it will output the success message along with the list of tags in the appropriate format.
The details of this step is given in the next subsection. +

==== Implementation of Scenario 2 +
* Converts the list of Tags to a list of String. +
* Sorts the String list in alphabetical order. +
* Appends the names to each other with the appropriate formatting by using a String Builder. +
* Output the result. +

==== Design Considerations +
**Aspect:** Order of Tags displayed +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display in alphabetical order. +
**Pros:** Easier to understand and more readable. +
**Cons:** May not be the most helpful way. +

**Alternative 2:** Display based on how many of each tag there are. (ascending order) +
**Pros:** Might be more meaningful for certain users and cases. +
**Cons:** Much more difficult to implement. Alphabetical order is generally easier to understand. +

---
**Aspect:** Implementation of `showtag` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a new command `showtag`. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. `showtag` command will be similar to the `list` command.. +
**Cons:** Must create function to convert tags to string. It does not fully utilize the existing `updateFilteredPersonList`. +

**Alternative 2:** Modify the `ListCommand`. +
**Pros:** Easier for user. They do not have to memorize some many commands.  +
**Cons:** The existing `ListCommand` will not only response for listing persons only. This Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `ListCommand` now needs to do two different things. +

=== Enhancement Added: Favourite/Unfavourite Persons

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=favourite]
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=unfavourite]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
Users will always want to differentiate some of their favourite contacts from the others so that they can find their frequently contacted persons easily.
Therefore, `FavouriteCommand` is implemented in Address++.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=favunfav]

#End of Extract#
