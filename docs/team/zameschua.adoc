== Introduction
=== What is CYNC
CYNC is an open-source software that helps small businesses to
track and nurture relationships with customers.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 8 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/zameschua/addressbook-level4/blob/master/collated/main/zameschua.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/tree/master/collated/test[Test code]]

=== Purpose of Portfolio
This portfolio serves as a documentation of my contributions towards CYNC, also other contributions to this module.

== Enhancements Added
=== Command Prediction

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=commandprediction]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Because the main mode of interaction with CYNC is via a Command Line Interface,
as a user, I often find it difficult to recall what are the exact commands that I need to type.

This is where the Command Prediction helps aid the user such that they do not have to remember
the entire command.

The Command Prediction was intentionally made simple for another developer to add another
set of predictions (extending beyond the default commands).

==== Justification

CYNC aims to make it as simple as possible for a small business owner to maintain good relations with their customers.

By enabling notifications and reminders, we can ensure that the users never miss a customer's birthaday,
 allowing them to prepare a gift card for their customers to show how much they care, or even keep track of
 when a customer is supposed to make payments so that they never miss a payment due again.

This will allow the users to focus on growing their business, while knowing well that CYNC will keep them
notified of important events.

== Other contributions

=== Contributions to CYNC
* I updated the GUI theme (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/pull/29[#29]) to make it
more aesthetically pleasing.
* I also reduced the use of 'magic number' color codes in the Stylesheets,
 instead replacing them with constants, and overall making the CSS more reusable and less prone to bugs.
* I made additional effort to ensure that the features being implemented by the team do not have
conflicting functions or implementations.
