=== Enhancement Added: A Universal Find Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

It allows users to locate specific contacts efficiently using all information available beyond name and tags.

=== Enhancement Added: Filtering of Find command

==== External behavior

---

The `find` command filters the list shown. Successive `find` makes the list smaller and smaller

---

==== Justification

By filtering the existing list, the user can narrow down the list to find the relevant contacts without exact information.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=filter]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Wildcard Symbol

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=wildcard]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The use of wildcard symbol `*` and `?` allows fuzzy search.


=== Enhancement Added: Resize Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=resize]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The resize command allows the user to enlarge/shrink the size of the main window conveniently using CLI so that he/she can have a view more contacts or make space in the screen for other applications.

=== Enhancement Added: Auto-Completion Suggestion

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tabcomplete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Auto-Completion allows users to type less. Moreover, since all suggestions are generated from the database, it reduces the chance of mistyping.


=== Enhancement Proposed: Add `filter` command

A `filter` command to filter away unwanted contacts in the list shown.
For instance, if the user want to see all contacts who are not his friends, he can filter away all contacts tagged with `friends`.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Rank Auto-Completion Suggestions by their occurance
If a certain keyword is frequently used, it should show up first in the suggestion menu.
