== Purpose

This project portfolio displays the contributions and enhancements made to the software, The Myth's Book,
along with its justifications made by Darren Chin. The portfolio will first introduce The Myth's Book and subsequently talk
about the enhancements and other contributions.

== Project: The Myth's Book
The Myth's Book is an address book dedicated for university students to store useful information such
as websites, phone numbers and emails of the people around them for personal usage. The application helps students
to keep track of birthday dates and upcoming events through a calendar and facilitate convenient access to their friend's website
and even Google Maps location through the in-built browser panel in the application. Furthermore, there are many
useful tools such as finding group tags (e.g. friends, neighbours) and switching themes for better user preference and usability.

The Myth's Book is a `Command Line Input` based software which helps caters to students who are efficient and comfortable
in typing out command line inputs to manipulate with information of their contacts in the address book.
The Myth's Book is a software application that is coded in `Java` programming language.

=== Enhancement Added: Sort Command, Sort Names Alphabetically

This section includes the behaviour and justification of the sort command and explains how it is implemented.

Code on GitHub: Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/46[#46]

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

University students are often very particular about the way things are organized around them and
the `Sort Command` helps to organize the contacts list of The Myth's Book by sorting the contacts based
on their names alphabetically. Therefore, this contributes to the aspect of user friendliness and allows
users to be able to look through the overall contacts list in an orderly manner whenever needed with better user-readability.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

University students are often very particular about convenience in using software programs and
the `Access Command` allows users to be able to access the website of a contact through the in-built browser panel which
 eliminates tediousness and helps to facilitate ease of accessing websites for users. The command also helps users to avoid opening other programs and avoid switching
between programs so as to facilitate user-friendliness and create an `all-in-one` platform in The Myth's Book.

==== Justification

University students are often very particular about convenience in using software programs and
the `Location Command` allows users to be able to access the address of a contact through the in-built browser panel
using Google Maps Search which helps to facilitate ease of access for users.
The command also helps users to avoid opening other programs and avoid switching between programs so as to facilitate

=== Enhancement Added: Optional fields for Add Command

This section includes the behaviour and justification of the tweaking of `AddCommand` and explains how it is implemented.

Code on GitHub: Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/99[#99], https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/96[#96]

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add1]
image::UGPrefix.PNG[width="500"]
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add2]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The `AddCommand` can take in `9` different fields (name, phone, email, school email, home number,
website, birthday, address, tags) which is a lot of information required for users to fill in
if all were necessary to fill in in order to add a contact.
Furthermore, University students are often very particular about convenience
in using software programs and it is not realistically possible for users to attain every
piece of information from a contact when adding a contact.
The implementation of optional fields when adding a contact allows users to only need the
name, phone and email of a person and be able to add contacts with ease.
The enhancement also helps to facilitate user-friendliness in using The Myth's Book.

=== Enhancement Added: Website field for Person Class

This section includes the behaviour and justification of adding website field for each contact in The Myth's Book.

Code on GitHub: Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/57[#57]

==== External behavior

---

Users are able to store website information for every single one of their contacts in The Myth's Book with any valid link.

The website inputted should follow this format `https://www.anyName.com/anyContent` where both `anyName` and `anyContent` can be alphanumeric. +
You must have `https://www.` and a domain name like `.com` or `.net` in the inputted website or it will result in inputted format error. +

---

==== Justification

As most university students frequently use social network platforms today, it is viable that
users might want to have the website information of their contacts.
The implementation of website field for a contact allows users to carry out activities
of university students such as browsing a person's social network website in The Myth's Book.

---
==== Implementation

---

In the implementation of the website field, instead of using a self implemented regex, the testing
of validity of an inputted website uses a url validator method that is provided by
the package belonging to `Apache Commons Validator` which proves to be more useful and
efficient than a self-implemented regex to test a validity of a link.

---

=== Enhancement Added: Switching between Persons Mode and Events Mode

This section includes the behaviour and justification of the switching between modes in The Myth's Book and explains how it is implemented.

Code on GitHub: Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/142[#142]

==== External behavior

---


There are two modes in The Myth’s Book which are the Persons mode and the Events mode.
For the two different modes, there will be different groups of command available for users to use.

The commands are categorised into three groups:

* `Person Commands` such as the `AddCommand` or `EditCommand`.
* `Event Commands` such as the `AddEventCommand` or `DeleteEventCommand`.
* `General Commands` such as the `HelpCommand` or `SwitchThemeCommand`.

The `General Commands` can be used in both Persons and Events modes.

By default, whenever you start the application, The Myth’s Book, you should be in Persons mode.

By typing `list`, you will enter the Persons mode, where you can only use `Person Commands` such as add, delete, edit, access and others which are listed in Persons Command Features of the User Guide.

By typing `events`, you will enter the Events mode, where you can only use `Event Commands` such as addevent and deleteevent, and the details of how to use them will be listed in Events Command Features of the User Guide.

---

==== Justification

The implementation of the mode switching will help to maintain better usability as it can separate
and classify features and commands for both Persons and Events. This will allow commands related
to both modes to exist concurrently with lesser bugs in the application where user can use The
Myth's Book with better user-friendliness. As bugs might exist when users might commands related
to `Person Commands` while he is viewing the `EventListPanel`, there is a need to actually
implement the mode switching enhancement to improve the software and keep the software as bug-free as
possible for better user experience.

=== Enhancement Added: Convert inputted names to become capitalized fully(Upper CamelCase)

This section includes the behaviour and justification of fully capitalizing inputted names for each contact and explains how it is implemented.

Suggestion from joppeel who did acceptance testing for The Myth's Book: https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/issues/108[Suggestion]

Idea adapted from user, scottb, on StackOverFlow: https://stackoverflow.com/users/2015912/scottb[Profile of scottb] https://stackoverflow.com/a/15738441[Code Implementation]

My Code on GitHub: Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/123/commits/cf57e5e78374ec3ee69125e8342ed27c9efa06da[#123]

==== External behavior

---

It will convert names of contacts who are added into The Myth's Book to Upper CamelCase.

* Suppose a user inputs name `daRRen cHiN` for a contact, name will be handled and displayed as `Darren Chin`
once contact is added successfully into The Myth's Book.

---
==== Justification

The implementation of capitalizing names fully for a contact being added allows users to
be able to view a sorted person list in a more orderly manner(alphabetically and lexicographically)
when the contact list is sorted through the `Sort Command` in The Myth's Book.

---

==== Implementation

---

The implementation of converting inputted names to become capitalized fully(Upper CamelCase) helps
to complement the sort command for users.

Suppose a user would like to add a new contact with an address to The Myth's Book and executes the `AddCommand`
by typing `add n/adam bait e/adambait@example.com p/98123414`.

The conversion of the name is processed in this way:

. User will input `add n/adam bait e/adambait@example.com p/98123414 a/18 Taiseng`.
. Input of user will be handled by the `LogicManager` and parse as an argument through the `AddressBookParser` and `AddCommandParser`.
. `AddCommandParser` will check for all the prefixes inputted and the existence of compulsory prefixes required.
. Inputted string name of `"adam bait"` will then be handled through methods in `ParserUtil.java` and `Name.java`.
. Inputted string name will be accepted as a parameter into a constructor of `Name.java`.
. In the constructor, string name will be be parsed through the method `toCapitalized` where
only the first initial of each part of a full name (also after every whitespace) is converted to upper case while
the rest of the letters of the name are converted to lowercase.
. The string name of `"adam bait"` will converted to `"Adam Bait"` after being parsed through
the method and stored as a string variable that is part of the `Name` class which is returned back to
the `AddCommandParser` so that it can add the person as a contact.
. User will be able to see contact's name being displayed as `"Adam Bait"` once contact is
added successfully.

Code of `toCapitalized` method inside `Name.java`:
[source,java]
----
public static String toCapitalized(String s) {
    final String delimiters = " ";
    StringBuilder newString = new StringBuilder();
    boolean isCapital = true;

    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        c = (isCapital) ? Character.toUpperCase(c) : Character.toLowerCase(c);
        newString.append(c);

        isCapital = (delimiters.indexOf((int) c) >= 0);
    }
    return newString.toString();
}

=== Enhancement Proposed: Importing and Exporting of contacts
==== External behavior & Justification

---

This enhancement proposal allows users to be able to export contacts so that the information of their
own contacts can be conveniently imported and integrated into the same software, The Myth's Book, on another computer.
This also helps to allows users to be able to save their contacts in a portable state that is
able to load itself in the case of software corruption where user can just simply reinstall software
and load the saved state of their contact list.

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Phone messaging of contacts through software
==== External behavior & Justification

---

This enhancement proposal will enable users to be able to send phone messages to a contact
via The Myth's Book. By proposing such an enhancement, it will make the storing of phone
information for contacts more useful as users would be able to send messages conveniently
in The Myth's Book without having to access their phones.
