=== Enhancement Added: Improve flexibility of `add` command

Adds a person to Death Note +

  Format: `add n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [w/WEBSITE] [pic/PATH] [t/TAG]...`

  Shorthand: `a n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [w/WEBSITE] [pic/PATH] [t/TAG]...`

==== Justification

This feature allows flexibility in the usage of Death Note.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

This is done by allowing the creation of `Phone`, `Email`, etc. objects with `null` parameter.

Problems arise when these field classes can created with a `null` parameter. Necessary changes are mostly about additional
checks of `null` in its respective class:

----
    public Phone(String phone) throws IllegalValueException {
        String trimmedPhone = phone == null ? null : phone.trim();
        if (!isValidPhone(trimmedPhone)) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_PHONE_CONSTRAINTS);
        }
        this.value = trimmedPhone;
    }
----

----
    public static boolean isValidPhone(String test) {
        return test == null || test.matches(PHONE_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----

----
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (other == this) { // short circuit if same object
            return true;
        } else if (!(other instanceof Phone)) { // instanceof handle nulls
            return false;
        } else if (this.value == ((Phone) other).value) {
            return true;
        } else if (this.value != null && this.value.equals(((Phone) other).value)) { // state check
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

=== Enhancement Added: Open or create new address book

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W10-B3/DeathNote/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]#

Opens or creates another Death Note data file from within the application.

`Open` On GUI:

==== Justification

This feature allows user to manage different version of address book. Suitable when more than one user
are using the app on the same device.

==== Implementation

_Figure 4.2.1 : Open New Address Book Sequence Diagram_

As you can see from the diagram, when the `Open` button is clicked in the Application, it raises an event and triggers `MainApp` to update new Application metadata and restart the UI.

This loads the selected XML file which opens a new address book with contacts from selected XML file.

=== Enhancement Added: Improve `find` command


==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W10-B3/DeathNote/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]#

Finds persons who matches the given attributes. +

  Format: `find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [w/WEBSITE] [t/TAG]... `

  Shorthand: `f [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [w/WEBSITE] [t/TAG]...`

* Searches based on the input and prefix.
* The search is case insensitive for NAME. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords for NAME does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* The other prefixes require the exact words
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
