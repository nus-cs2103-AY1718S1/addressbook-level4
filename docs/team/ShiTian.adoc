=== Enhancement Added: Add Picture

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=picture]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Autocomplete

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since there are a multitude of commands available to the user, it is highly improbably that they would be able to remember
all the given commands. As such, it would be convenient to just remember partially the what the commands are and allow an
autocompleted list to generate the commands for them.

=== Enhancement Added: Highlight

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=highlight]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since there will be occasions when the Administrator of the Residence wants to select a specific group of individuals,
i.e. students who have yet to register for the next semester's housing, it would be convenient for them to be able to
view the group with respect to those that have registered, perhaps to judge the rough percentage of residents who have
registered.
