= Gabriel Li - Project Portfolio

== Project: Contact Plus

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=welcome]

link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/lancehaoh.md[[Functional code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Delete Tag

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletetag-command]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Enables users to reorganize their social circles. E.g. when a student has completed the module CS2101,
he/she could remove the tag `CS2101 groupmate` from all contacts in
`Contact Plus` as it is no longer applicable.

==== Implementation

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Autocomplete

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete-feature]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may find it difficult ot remember the exact spelling of commands.
Some may feel that it is tiring to type the some of the long command names.
`Autocomplete` enables the automatic insertion of command names so that
the user is relieved of all these problems.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete-mechanism]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Extended Autocomplete

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=extended-autocomplete-feature]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

While `Autocomplete` allows the automatic completion of command names,
users may also find it difficult to remember the format of every command.
`extended autocomplete` enables the user to automatically insert the format of
commands so that the user just needs to fill in his own information into the address book
without needing to remember anything related to the commands.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=extended-autocomplete-mechanism]

#End of Extract#

---



=== Enhancement Added: Multiple Filter for Contacts

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=multifilter-feature]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The `find` command only allows the user to find contacts by name keyword(s). Multiple contacts could
have the same keyword(s). Furthermore, the user may not remember the contact's name.
`multifilter` gives the user multiple choices to filter his contacts in such cases.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=multifilter-mechanism]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: List Tasks

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=listtask-command]

#End of Extract#

#End of Extract#

---



=== Enhancement Added: Delete Tasks

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletetask-command]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

`deletetask` enables the user to organize his/her tasks in `Contact Plus` (i.e. he/she can delete
those that are no longer needed).

==== Implementation

---

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=deletetask-mechanism]

#End of Extract#

---



=== Enhancement Added: Sound effects for Commands

==== External behavior

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=music-feature]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Sound effects provide additional and clear feedback to the user about the
outcome of his/her command.

==== Implementation
