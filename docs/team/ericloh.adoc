=== Enhancement Added: Change calendar view

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=calendar]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed (for Version 2.0)
* More CLI for calendar view. Allow users to go to a selected date.
** Currently there is no way for the user to navigate through the calendar without using the mouse. It would be useful
for the doctors if they have the access to such shortcuts.
* Make deletion of appointments easier. Remove the need to type in the whole description to delete.
** Current deletion is too verbose and takes too much effort. This implementation has to be reworked in order to use
the index for deletion instead of the name.
