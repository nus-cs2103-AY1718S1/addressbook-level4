=== Enhancement: Modify Undo/Redo mechanism

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=undoredo]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The current design is that each Undoable command knows how to undo and redo individually.
Compare to the original design: saving whole address book for undoing, my design will save a lot of memory.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=undoredo]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement: Edit an event

=== Enhancement: Interact events and persons

==== External behavior

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=portrait]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `remark`

{Explain similar to the Undo/Redo feature above.}
