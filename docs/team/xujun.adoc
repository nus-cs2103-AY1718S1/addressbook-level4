=== Enhancement Added: Search Box

==== Justification

An efficient search algorithm is needed for students to locate contacts speedily and conveniently.
The previous design of `find` command greatly reduces speed of search by requiring user to type `enter`
with (almost) exactly matching keywords.

The search box solves this issue by responding to user input in real time.
The prefix matching rule is designed to specially suit this real time response, allowing users to find contacts
even if they do not remember their full names.

Furthermore, the search box is more powerful because it searches for name, phone and tag in one textfield. This makes
searching integrated and thus convenient for the user.

=======
=== Enhancement Added: more powerful `edit` command
A more powerful `edit` command that has several sub-features and brings multiple benefits.

==== Edit multiple contacts at the same time

External Behaviour:



=== Enhancement Proposed: Add support for foreign languages

NUS has a lot of international students. It is important to allow CRUD in languages other than English to cater to these students'
needs. Moreover, UI should be able to display in other languages.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add support for phone country code

NUS is a tertiary institution with global impact. A student in it will come across foreign numbers that needs saving.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add support for phone number tags

As almost all modern address applications do, multiple phones should be able to be differentiated according to their uses,
for example `work` phone and `home` phone.
