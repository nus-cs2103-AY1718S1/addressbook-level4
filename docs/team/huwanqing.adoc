=== Enhancement Added: find

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

For users who need to frequently locate their contacts, it would be much faster with a find command. The command can find contacts by both person names and tags. In particular, find tag can find a group of contacts with the particular tag. Such
find procedure is fast and can produce results more efficiently.

==== Justification

For a event, users can join its participants to the event in Planno. In this way, the user can quickly obtain information of the participants in the future.
The feature will be extremely helpful if the event involve a large number of people. The user only need to join them in the beginning, and can quickly pull out information, such as emails, phone numbers in the future.
