=== Enhancement Added: Find

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users need more flexible "find" command. They may need to search other fields besides NAME. Also, a fuzzy search is helpful when they cannot remember their contact clearly.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Lock/Unlock

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=lockunlock]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Todo

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tdo]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The "todo" command provides users a more flexible way to attach their todo event with people in their contacts.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=tdo]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Switch

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=switch]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The "switch" command helps user to switch between browser and todo list.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=switch]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `Calendar`

This command will display a calendar with all todo items according to their date and time. It is more intuitive to see all the todo items on a calendar. Also, calendar with time picker options will makes easier to add todo item.
