== Project: BoNUS

**BoNUS** is a desktop personal organizer application dedicated to NUS students to carry out various tasks such as storing
contacts, scheduling for upcoming events, timetable planning as well as a calendar to better organise their campus life.

This project is the result of a semester-long software engineering https://nus-cs2103.github.io/website/[module] at
http://www.nus.edu.sg/[NUS]. It is built my teammates and me, as listed link:../AboutUs.html[here]. Most of the backend codes
are written in Java, while https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm#JFXST784[JavaFX]
is adapted as the frontend framework.

=== Enhancement Added: Generic Property

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=genericProperty]

---

==== Justification

Our application **BoNUS** will not be able to stand out from all the similar https://nus-cs2103.github.io/website/admin/projectList.html[products]
if we simply provide users with a few additional fields to store the information of their contacts. Instead, to suit the
various needs from users, we have to provide the flexibility to allow users to define customize properties on their own.

Users can use the `config --add-property` command to define as many new properties as they want, after which they could
set these properties when they use the `add` command to add a new contact.

In the current design and implementation, the `PropertyManager` class is used to store and manage the meta-data of all
properties. Default properties like `Name`, `Phone`, `Email` and `Address` are pre-loaded into `PropertyManager`, while
user-defined properties will be added into `PropertyManager` by `config --add-property` command.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=genericProperty]

=== Enhancement Proposed: Import From BoNUS-specified Script file

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=importScript]

---

==== Justification

This feature is meant for advanced users. To build an **epic** application, we need to essentially build an _ecosystem_ for
this software. According to the _Unix_ philosophy, providing a shell scripting and command language is the minimum requirement
for a complete system.

With the support for scripting file, advance users (or system administers if **BoNUS** is used as an enterprise application)
can generate a scripting file and import it into **BoNUS**. Data management and frequent operations can be done easily in
one step. Otherwise, they have to type one command each time in the GUI interface, which becomes a very tedious work.

The scripting file should consist of one or multiple valid **BoNUS** commands and each line can have **at most one** command.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Export Data to Microsoft Excel^TM^ Worksheet

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=exportExcel]

---

==== Justification

We already support `ExportCommand` so that users can save data to a separate location as a backup. However, `.xml` files
are not considered to be user-friendly (except for programmers and geeks).

Thus, it becomes essential for us to natively support exporting data to a format with better visuals. As stated before,
data stored in **BoNUS** can be considered as _tables_. Naturally, it comes to my mind that Microsoft Excel^TM^ would
be a perfect format to present data to users.

Users can type `--excel` as the additional option to specify Microsoft Excel^TM^ as the output format when they use `ExportCommand`.

== Project: Lions Befrienders Management System

I worked at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vwo/[CVWO (Computing for Voluntary Welfare Organisations)] as a web developer during the
Year 1 summer vacation.

My team at CVWO rewrote, upgraded and deployed the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vwo/projects/2017-lbsa.html[management
system] for https://www.lionsbefrienders.org.sg/[Lions Befrienders (Singapore)], which was formed in 1995 and served thousands
of senior citizens. This system saves a lot of time for staff at Lions Befrienders to manage their growing enormous clients
across the country, while ensuring high service quality.

== Project: A Multi-User 3D Game Environment for CS1101S

This project aims at building a 3D game environment to assist http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/[CS1101S] students in
learning programming. The game is built using https://unity3d.com/[Unity3D] game engine. It provides vivid visualization
to help students have a deeper understanding of the related data structure and algorithms used.

CS1101S is a module taught in the Department of Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. It serves as a rigorous
and thorough introduction to programming methodology.
