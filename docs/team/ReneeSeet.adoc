=== Enhancement Added: Mass Emailing

The mass emailing feature aims to help businesses reach out to their customers efficiently.

==== Justification

A mass emailing feature would allow businesses to send out monthly newsletters, greetings or reminders to all their customers.
It would be more efficient if businesses can send emails to specific group of customers defined by their tags.
By having this function, users need not go through the hassle of collating and manually typing out email addresses in other emailing platforms just to email their customers.

==== Future Improvements
Here are some possible enhancements for the mass emailing feature:

* Allow attachments to be send in emails.


=== Enhancement Added: Add Joined Date
Besides the details of customers, businesses especially those that uses a subscription model would want to keep track of customers' joined date as well.

==== Justification
Joined date can be useful for tracking customers' fees due date or how long customers has been supporting the business.

==== External behavior

When a new customer is added to CYNC, a joined date based on the current day will be generated and stored together with customers' details.
Customer's joined date can be viewed on their respective profile page.

==== Implementation

Upon entering a valid `add` command, CYNC will create a new `Person` object which includes a join date object.
The new person object will then be stored in the Storage locally. When profile page of a person is needed, it will get all its details from the storage.


==== Future Improvements
Here are the possible enhancements:

* Allow users to edit the joined date for customers.
* With the joined date of each customer, CYNC can calculate when customers' fees are due and send out automated reminders through email or sms to customers.
* CYNC can also send out automated anniversary emails to customers.

=== Enhancement Added: Login Page

I decided not to use the Login Page after I implemented it. As I realised that it led to much coupling which is undesirable.
I edited the test cases to go through the Login Page before every test. This cause the testcases to be dependent on the function.

==== Justification

Customers' information are valuable and businesses would want to protect and store them safely.
A login page on CYNC would deter unauthorised users to gain access to customers' data.
Furthermore, since both the Mass Emailing and the Calendar functions requires Google authentication, it can be done when logging into CYNC.

==== External behavior

Upon launching the application, you will be greeted with a login page as shown below.

You will be required to sign in with your Google email and password.

==== Implementation

Upon launching the application, the UI manager will load the login Panel only.
When user click the `Login` button or pressed `enter`, if the `email:` and `password:` textboxes are correct, a `LoginRequestEvent`
will be posted to the `EventsCenter`. This will unlock the rest of the components of `MainWindow` as well as displaying customers' informations.
If the textboxes are empty, CYNC will prompt the user to fill them.

==== Alternative Implementation

In order for the login function to be less coupled with the other functions, I should have implemented the login page on a different scene.
This will allow testing to be less coupled as we can test the login page on its own. Furthermore, it is not safe to store default password and email thus
first time users should be prompted to login to their google account first. Then, CYNC will update with the vaild email and password.
We can do so by integrating with Google Authentication API.


=== Enhancement Proposed: View user's email inbox
We should not limit users to only sending out emails. +
A possible feature for CYNC in the future would be to view emails from CYNC. +
A command `inbox` will list out all emails that user have and user can read and reply to them on CYNC.
This will allow them to reply to customers quickly and efficiently.
