== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
Sales Navigator is a desktop application designed to help sales executives
manage clients and events information in an efficient and effortless way. It
has a JavaFx-enabled GUI, but most of the operations can be performed by
typing commands into a CLI. It is written in Java and was built by modifying an
existing project Address Book Level 4.

=== Enhancement Added: Event Scheduling

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=schedule]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

For a sales executive, it is of utmost importance to keep all upcoming events
 in check, to avoid missing out on client calls or important sales meetings,
 and also to better arrange and prepare for upcoming events. A calendar would
  come handy in the Sales Navigator app as it provides a bird-eye's view of
  all scheduled events for a sales person, facilitates event scheduling,
  avoids scheduling clashing events, and also allows him/her to reschedule
  flexibly with drag-and-drop action.

=== Enhancement Added: Scheduling Recurring Event

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=repeat]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Some times, a sales executive might need to schedule regular calls to a
potential customer, or schedule regular meetings with an exisitng customer.
This calls for the need to be able to schedule recurring event. Since the period
 of the
call/meeting can vary largely from client to client, we also need to give
users the freedom of defining their own period of recurrence, instead of
being limited to "weekly/monthly", etc.

=== Enhancement Added: Update client's photo

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=photo]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

It is important for a sales person to build rapport quickly with a potential
client right after the initial contact, and adding a photo helps the user
familiarize with and relate to the potential client quickly, especially if
there has been limited contact. This makes contact management more efficient
and helps build long-lasting client relationships.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Automatically archive events

As the number of events accumulate, `eventlist` will quickly become unusable
due to the length of the list. Therefore, an archiving mechanism should be
implemented, which enables the app to remove old events (happening 14 days
before the current date) from the event list and add to an archive. This
clean-up should be run everyday and/or whenever the app starts.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Link events to clients

Linking scheduled events with contacts existing in the Sales Navigator app
can help sales executives better prepare for an upcoming event, and better
manage the events and contacts.
