=== Enhancement Added: Backup

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This is a simple way of backing up the current state of the address book before the user performs a complex series of commands that may not be undoable.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Clear command history

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=clearHistory]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

If information was added that may be too sensitive to be in the address book, clearing the command history ensures that the information is permanently removed.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=clearHistory]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Custom tag colours

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=colourTag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

A custom tag colour that is saved reduces confusion for the user and allows them to quickly identify people with the same tag quickly, especially if the address book is large.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=colourTag]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Shortest relationship path

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=relPath]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This allows PIs to find the most confident way in which two people are related in a relationship path. For example, a PI may use someone they know very well to contact someone they don't via the least amount of people possible.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=relPath]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `listrelated`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=listRelated]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This allows PIs to quickly see who is related to a specific person, and filter out extraneous information.
