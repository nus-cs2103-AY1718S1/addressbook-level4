== Project: Rolodex

include::../../README.adoc[tag=applicationDescription]

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/main/jo-lyn.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/jo-lyn.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Keyboard Shortcuts

==== Justification

Having keyboard shortcuts allows the user to navigate around the application with ease and speed.
This implementation should enable you to access all parts of Rolodex without using the mouse.
The table below shows the keyboard shortcuts that have been added, with the exception of shortcuts with the behavior `Exit the application`
and `View help window` which came with the original state of the application.

[[detailPanel]]
=== Enhancement Added: Person Detail Panel

==== Justification

The person detail panel aims to reduce cluttering of information in the contact list. With this panel,
the contact list will only have to store the essential information for identifying a person, whilst
additional information about the person will be displayed on this panel.

==== External Behavior

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1, tag=detailPanelImp]

---

=== Enhancement Added: Remark Field

==== Justification

The remark field allows the user to store miscellaneous notes about their contacts.
For example, a user might want to note down a hobby of a friend. Such information can be easily added to the contact
with the remark field.

==== External Behavior

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add Profile Pictures
