=== Enhancement Added: SortCommand

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sortcommand]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

I have added in a Sort Command to allow for easier filtering of the contact lists. This allows the user
to sort his or her contacts by alphanumeric order. One such application of this Sort Command could be sorting
people by their names after using the Find Command to find people with similar tags.

=== Enhancement Added: Enhanced command `DeleteCommand`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletecommand]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This feature allows for easy and efficient deleting of multiple contacts without requiring the user
to manually delete them one by one. This would make it more convenient for the user to delete unwanted contacts.
