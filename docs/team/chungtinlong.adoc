== ConTag
ConTag is an efficient and feature-packed desktop address book application for the most demanding business users and busiest frequent travellers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

=== Enhancement Added: Copy email address(es) of selected contacts

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=copy]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Multiple emails are copied rather than other fields as it is the most used mode of communication in a personal computer (PC),
which is where this application resides.

Phone numbers are seldom used as PCs do not typically have the ability to perform voice calls, and even web calls such as
Skype calls are usually able to take in both email and phone number inputs. Meanwhile, the physical address does not have
an urgent need to be copied as the Locate command in our app already copies the address and displays it on Google Maps.
As such, until user feedback proves otherwise, copying email addresses is the main priority for this feature.

In terms of mode of input, current multiple email copy works with one or more indices as the user can already filter for a small list of people
that may be of interest, cutting the amount of scrolling significantly. In addition, as we assume that most users
using the application would not have to send email to a massive number of recipients at a time, which may cause our implementation
to become prohibitively inefficient.

However, eventually allowing the command to accept a range of indices (copy 1 - 4 rather than 1 2 3 4), and even a "copy all"
command that takes in all currently displayed contacts, are potential planned features for v 2.0. We may need to conduct investigation
of user preferences and usage patterns to decide which input methods to include, as allowing too many modes of input can be
confusing to novice users and inefficient for the app to process (thereby increasing wait time and resource usage).

=== Enhancement Added: Infer name of country from a phone number's country code, and display it on the contact's panel

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=country_code]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Most importantly, this feature allows the user to skip the input of a new contact's country, and makes the country section
of the Address input optional as well. This reduces the number of steps during contact creation and modification.

This implementation involves detecting the start and end of the country code prefix in a phone number with "+" and " "
respectively because this is a widely used international convention, and the plus sign and first white space are unique.
This allows for completely reliable detection of the start and end of every country code. Codes are validated against a current
local database of all valid country codes (at time of application release) and invalid codes are rejected, so that users are
notified of user input errors immediately.

The default "Country not available" status for numbers with no country code are designed to give completeness and symmetry to
the contact list, so that users are not left wondering if the "missing" line in some contacts are from deliberate design.
We expect to update shortly and be able to detect and infer the country name from the Address.

A future update will include support for multiple phone numbers as a standard, with multiple countries displayed if phone
numbers differ in country codes, as well.
