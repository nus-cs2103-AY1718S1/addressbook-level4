=== Enhancement Added: Remark Command

==== Justification

==== Sort Command

Sorting is important to the viewability of lists as it helps one to find the relevant information more easily as
opposed to scanning through the entire list for their desired information. The current sort command implementation
only supports sorting by name, but further enhancements will allow it to sort in ascending and descending orders
by name, email, address, phone numbers, etc.

==== UserPerson/UserProfile
The UserProfile is an object that contains the UserPerson details. It can later be extended to include additional data.
A GUI will allow the user to view their current User Person details, and allow editing of the User Person information.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `remark`

The remark command allows additional information to be displayed on a person's card.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `sort`

The sort command would allow the user to display their list of contacts in an order that they prefer. Some users may want to
view their contacts in order by First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Address or simply by the date they added the contact.

=== Enhancement Proposed: User Profile/User Person

The User Profile will contain the user's contact card, which sets up for a later feature where contact cards can be shared.
The user would then be able to share their contact instead of requiring others to key in the add command. This could also
be extended to implementation of multiple users of one address book app. Each user profile would contain their own address
book and user contact card. A GUI will allow ease of user profile editing as well as viewing of the user profile.

=== Other contributions
