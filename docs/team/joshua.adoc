=== Enhancement Added: Remark Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=remark]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Justification

The remark command allows additional information to be displayed on a person's card.

=== Enhancement Added: Sort Command

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=SortCommand]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Justification

Sorting is important to the viewability of lists as it helps one to find the relevant information more easily as
opposed to scanning through the entire list for their desired information. The current sort command implementation
only supports sorting by name, but further enhancements will allow it to sort in ascending and descending orders
by name, email, address, phone numbers, etc.

=== Enhancement Added: UserPerson/User Profile

---

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=updateUserPerson]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=userProfileUI]

#End of Extract#
---

The UserProfile is an object that contains the UserPerson details. It can later be extended to include additional data.
A GUI will allow the user to view their current User Person details, and allow editing of the User Person information.


==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=UserProfile]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Justification

The User Profile will contain the user's contact card, which sets up for a later feature where contact cards can be shared.
The user would then be able to share their contact instead of requiring others to key in the add command. This could also
be extended to implementation of multiple users of one address book app. Each user profile would contain their own address
book and user contact card. A GUI will allow ease of user profile editing as well as viewing of the user profile.

=== Other contributions

* Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
* Wrote additional tests to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
