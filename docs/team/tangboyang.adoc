*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T11-B3/main/blob/master/collated/main/tby1994.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T11-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/tby1994.md[Test code]]


=== Enhancement Added: switch

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=switch]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

With the integration of address book and task manager, users are required to memorize many commands. User would need to type a longer command keyword such as: `addtask` and `addperson`.

Hence, adding switch command mode feature allows user to remember less commands. It will shorten the command keywords from `addtask` and `addperson` to just `add`.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=switch]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: find task

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

With many tasks to the application, it is hard to browse through each task to find the target task

Hence, with find task feature, user can easily search for the target task

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: select task

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=select]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The task tag feature allows user to include contacts that are involved in the task.

Hence, with the select task feature, when user selects the task select task feature will auto search for the contacts who are involved in the task.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=select]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: list task

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=list]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

After user conduct a search for task, the user the user can view back the whole task list with `list` feature.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=list]

#End of Extract#

=== Possible idea

One possible idea is to include notification for task deadline. User will be notified if the deadline is on the day itself. Notification will be shown when user opens Mobilize.

This feature can remind the user about the task deadline.
