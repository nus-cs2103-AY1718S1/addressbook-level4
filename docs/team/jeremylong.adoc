== Project: MedNus
MedNus is a desktop address book application used by Medical Professionals. +

MedNus aims to eliminate the existing inefficient and space consuming filing system and aid medical professionals +
in working efficiently and effectively.

MedNus contains all the functionality doctors need - appointment setting, recording of +
patient's information, storing personal data and many more. +

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. +
It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

* Contact sharing - Share contacts with other medical professionals using MedNus
* Synchronize MedNus with other applications such as mobile contacts and Facebook
* Additional tab to display detailed information of patient instead of displaying information on filtered list screen
* Real time tracking of patient's health condition by syncing to applications such as Healthy 365
