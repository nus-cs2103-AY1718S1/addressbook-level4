=== Enhancement Added: Drop-down List

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=dropdownlist]

==== Justification
It will be difficult for the user to memorise all the commands. The drop-down list suggests possible commands as he/she types,
making keying in commands much easier.

Users can also make use of the drop-down list to type commands faster. They can directly select the correct suggestion without having to
manually type out the command word in full.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1,tag=dropdownlist]

=== Enhancement Added: Auto-completion

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=autocomplete]

==== Justification

It will be difficult for the user to remember all the fields and the corresponding prefixes. Auto-completion ensures that the user will know exactly what is required.
Auto-selection of the placeholder improves the user experience, because the user can directly type in information without having to manually place the cursor.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1,tag=auto-completion]

=== Enhancement Added: Opening Email Composer

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=email]

==== Justification

This feature makes emailing a contact much easier. The user no longer has to go through the tedious process of copying the contact's email address, opening the email application
or website and pasting the email address there. All these can be done with a short and simple command within two seconds.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1,tag=email]

=== Enhancement Added: Keyboard Shortcuts for Commands with Auto-complete Function

==== External behavior

The table below shows all auto-complete command shortcuts.

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=auto-complete-shortcut]

==== Justification

The above shortcuts provide a faster way of using the command-line interface.
Users can simply activate auto-completion with a key press without the need to type in the command word and press kbd:[Tab] to activate auto-completion.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=1,tag=auto-complete-shortcut]

=== Enhancement Proposed: Integration of Social Media

Link Rolodex with the user's Facebook account and automatically match contacts in Rolodex to the user's Facebook friends, so that the user can view their friends' social media updates in Rolodex.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Prompt the User for Confirmation before Execution of Dangerous Commands

Before executing commands `clear` and `exit`, ask the user "Are you sure you want to...?". Continue with the execution if the user responds "yes", stop the execution otherwise.

These two commands are considered dangerous because the entire contact list can be cleared or the current Rolodex can be closed. The confirmation can make sure that they are not executed by accident.

An implementation of confirmation dialog box can be found https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/pull/114[here]. It is not used in the current version of Rolodex due to project requirement.
Command line confirmation (the user types "yes" in the command box) is a more recommended implementation that integrates well with the command-lind interface.
