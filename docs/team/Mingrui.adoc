*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/main/mingruiii.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/jo-lyn.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Auto-completion

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=autocomplete]

---


==== Justification

It is difficult for the user to remember all the fields and the corresponding prefixes. Auto-completion ensures that the user will know exactly what is required.
Auto-selection of the placeholder will improve user experience by a lot, because the user can directly type in information without having to manually place the cursor.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=auto-completion]

=== Enhancement Added: Opening email composer

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=email]

---

==== Justification

This feature makes emailing a contact much easier. The user no longer has to go through the tedious process of copying the contact's email address, opening the email application
or website and pasting the email address there. All these can be done with a short and simple command within two seconds.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Integration of social media

Link Rolodex with the user's Facebook account and automatically match contacts in Rolodex to the user's Facebook friends, so that the user can view their friends' social media updates in Rolodex.
