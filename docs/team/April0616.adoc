=== Enhancement Added: RemarkCommand

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=remarkCommand]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
Existing tags are too short for the user to put down the noteworthy thing of a contact,
and the remark for a person are more descriptive and unique so that you can always look back on.
The remark command is designed to be an undoable command, and a new attribute named 'Remark' is
added to the 'Person' class. The remark of a person will be displayed in the person information panel
if the user key in the select command.
