== Project: MedNus
MedNus is a desktop contacts application targeted at medical professionals.
With the rise of electronic health records, doctors are increasingly proficient with the keyboard.
MedNus is designed to complement this new trend by ensuring that all its contacts management features may be accessed through the speedy command-line interface.
No feature is exclusive to the GUI or mouse. +

MedNus has a GUI which aids the visualisation of appointment timings in particular. This was created with JavaFX. +

MedNus is written in Java. It has about 10,000 lines of code. +

=== Portfolio purpose (for CS2101)
This portfolio was made to document the features I contributed to this project.
For each feature, it details:

* The external behaviour of each feature, extracted from the User Guide
* Justifications for why it was built in that manner
* Internal implementations, extracted from the Developer Guide

---

=== Enhancement Added: Batch deletion of contacts by tag

---

==== External behaviour

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=batch]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Batch deletions make it less tedious to perform deletions on multiple contacts.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=batch]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Display potential duplicate contacts

---

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=dups]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Duplicate contacts can accumulate over time. The `Duplicates` command compiles a list of potential duplicate contacts for the user to review.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=dups]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Copy contact email address to clipboard

---

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=copy]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Embracing the keyboard-centric interaction of MedNus, even copying data into the userâ€™s clipboard is possible using purely keyboard commands. The Copy command lets users do just that.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=copy]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed for V2.0

* Skype username field and ability to pull contacts from Skype
** This is useful for telemedicine / telehealth which is essentially remote doctor consulting facilitated by video-calls
** This would further solidify MedNus's position as a relevant product for medical professionals of today
* Command that maps (patient contacts) with (doctor contacts specialising in their illness) and drafts referral letters for them
** This is useful for private doctors in particular, for whom networks of referrals are poorly documented, yet crucial to their business

---

=== Other contributions

* Drafted a light UI theme
* Revamped the Developer Guide content with Eric
* Unified diagram styles in User Guide
