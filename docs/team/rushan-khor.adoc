=== Enhancement Added: Batch deletion of contacts by tag

---

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=batch]

---

==== Justification

Batch deletions make it less tedious to perform deletions on multiple contacts.

---

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=batch]

---

=== Enhancement Added: Display potential duplicate contacts

---

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=dups]

---

==== Justification

Duplicate contacts can accumulate over time. The `duplicates` command compiles a list of potential duplicate contacts for the user to review.

---

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=dups]

---

=== Enhancement Added: Copy contact email address to clipboard

---

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=copy]

---

==== Justification

Embracing the keyboard-centric interaction of MedNus, even copying data into the user’s clipboard is possible using purely keyboard commands. The Copy command lets users do just that.

---

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=copy]

---
