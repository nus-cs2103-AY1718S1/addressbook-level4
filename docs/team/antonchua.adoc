==== Justification

This feature enables our users to quickly access and identify a subset of their contacts, known as Favourites, enhancing the usability of our application for people with a large number of contacts. The command format is unified, increasing ease of use by decreasing the number of commands the user has to remember to use the feature.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add favourites starring

A star will be displayed next to the contact's name if he/she is a Favourite contact, and he/she will always appear at the top of the main contact list. This will further ease identification of the user's most-used contacts.
