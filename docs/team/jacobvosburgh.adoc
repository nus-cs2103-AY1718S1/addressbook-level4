=== Enhancement Proposed: Replace Edit button with direct edits to the person cards

Instead of opening an edit window, pressing the edit button should turn the person card into a series of text boxes that already have the current values of those characteristics, to allow rapid fixes of typos. Additionally, tags will become removable via a button on the tag, and another button creates an empty text box for a new tag.
