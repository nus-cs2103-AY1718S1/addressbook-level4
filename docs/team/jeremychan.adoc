== Project: DeathNote

DeathNote is a Command-line Interface (CLI) desktop address book application which is able to manage contacts easily.
The user interacts with the application using a CLI, using commands to manage contacts; adding, deleting or editing contacts.

The aim of DeathNote, besides managing contacts, is to be able to bring entertainment to the user.
DeathNote has a small twist on being an address book application as it has aliases for its commands
and the amount of entertainment can only be determined by the user's creativity.

It has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6k Lines of Code (LoC).

Tags can be added using `add` command while adding a contact or `edit` command if the contact already exists.

* `add n/Dwayne Johnson t/friend` +

* `edit 1 t/colleague` +
Edits the tag of the 1st person to be "colleague"
* `edit 1 t/` +
Removes all tag from the 1st person

We have colors for tags so it is easier to distinguish different tags.
