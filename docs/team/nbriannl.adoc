== Project: UniFy
UniFy is a desktop Address Book application for University students, particularly those from NUS (National University of Singapore).

The user is able to manage the many people he meets in University, keep track of his friends' Birthdays, view his friendâ€™s timetables, and much more.
Most of the user interactions are via CLI, while there exists a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has
about 6kLoC.

The source code is based on the  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4] project created by SE-EDU initiative.
