=== Enhancement Added: Custom Field

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=customField]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Different students have their own custom fields such a nick name, courses etc. which is not exhaustive.
Therefore, this feature is designed for users to add as many custom fields for each contact as they want so that they can customise each contact.

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deleteByName]

#End of Extract#

When there is a lot of contacts in the contact book, it will be easier for users to locate a particular contact by the name and delete it directly, as compared to finding the index of the contact in the long list.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `Background`

The Background command will allow users to add a background image for the Contact Book.
This command would allow users to customise their Contact Book to have an appearance that they desire.
