#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Different students have their own custom fields such a nick name, courses etc. which is not exhaustive.
Therefore, this feature is designed for users to add as many custom fields for each contact as they want so that they can customise each contact.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `Background`

This command would allow users to customise their Contact Book to have an appearance that they desire.
