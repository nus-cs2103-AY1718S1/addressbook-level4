=== Enhancement Added: Managing additional phones

==== External behavior

---

Before adding any additional phone number, the `personalInformationPanel` will only display the primary phone number.
See the image below for illustration.

To add an additional phone number to the person, we can use PhoneCommand in two different formats.

* **Format 1 : using index to locate target person** `updatePhone INDEX add NUMBER` +
This INDEX is the index of the target person in the Contact Book. A Sample command is illustrated below.

After press `Enter`, the command result will be shown in the `resultDisplay` box as below.

The `personalInformationPanel` will also be updated and display this additional phone number as illustrated below.

==== Justification

NUS has a large proportion of international students and they may have to save multiple phone numbers.
This additional phone list allows them to save all the contact numbers, local or overseas.
