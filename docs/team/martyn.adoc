== Project: OurAb
OurAb is a CLI(Command Line Interface)-based desktop Address Book application written in Java, targeted at university students.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/main[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/test[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Shortcut Command

==== External behavior

Users can type a shortcut command for 16 commands, where entering the first letter(s) of the command also returns the same functionality:
1) Add
2) Delete
3) Edit
4) Find
5) History
6) List
7) Redo
8) Select
9) Undo
10) AddMeeting
11) DeleteTag
12) ListByMostSearched
13) Pref
14) NextMeeting
15) Map
16) Search

e.g. entering "l" will also return a list of persons in the address book

---

==== Justification

To make it more convenient for experienced users, who will be able to use the address book more efficiently once they are familiar with
the shortcuts. Users can refer to the user guide for the list of the command shortcuts.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

Alternatively to COMMAND_WORD, commands also have COMMAND_ALIAS which AddressBookParser will also accept as a valid input to execute the
desired command

[source,java]
----
     public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "add";
     public static final String COMMAND_ALIAS = "a";
----

[source,java]
----
        case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case AddCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments);
----

e.g. Both "add" and "a" can be used to execute the AddCommand function

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Shortcut implementation +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an alias, shortened form of the command +
**Pros:** Intuitive and easier to remember +
**Cons:** Might have overlapping aliases, requiring updates +
**Alternative 2:** Use a index for shortcuts +
**Pros:** Easier to map each command +
**Cons:** Less intuitive, and harder to remember

=== Enhancement Added: Search Command

=== External Behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.7. Search for persons by parameter: Search Since v1.3]]#

Finds persons whose details match the given keywords. +
Format: 'search KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORD]'

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Parameters are searched
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `search John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `search Serangoon` +
Returns `Bernice` and `David`, who stay in Serangoon

image::search-command-before.png[width="790"]
Before: User displaying contacts using the list command

image::search-command-after.png[width="790"]
After: Search command using the 'Serangoon' keyword


From this example, it can be understood that by searching Serangoon, we can see that it has listed all the people living in Serangoon, namely 'Bernice' and 'David'

---

==== Justification

Allows users to have a more powerful search function, which will become more useful when the address book increases in size.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: command-code-search-code]]#

The keywords are generated as list of strings, which is then checked against the details of the persons
in address book.

The details are returned as strings, by the ReadOnlyPerson method in the person model. The list of searched
people is then continually updated, before it is finally returned to the user

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** implementation of `Search` command over `Find`  +
**Pros:** More powerful search tool +
**Cons:** Unnecessary results may be returned for larger address books

=== Enhancement Added: Map Command

=== External Behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: searching-for-a-person-s-address-by-google-maps-code-map-code-code-since-v1-4-code]]#

Displays a google map search based of the person's address of the given index in the browser panel. +
Format: 'map [INDEX]'

****
* Selects the person and loads the Google maps page of the person's address at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Example of a MapCommand search of Alex Yeoh, index 1 of the list.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to use google maps as a way to visualise the person's address, and potentially find nearby meeting spots

---

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: command-code-map-code]]#

==== Implementation

When 'map' command is executed, it retrieves the current list of people,
and selects the person's address based on the index given.

The address is then passed into a url template for a page loader to display
the google maps on the browser panel

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Passing URL directly +
**Alternative 1:** Use google maps API +
**Pros:** More powerful and secure search +
**Cons:** Unnecessary imports of dependencies, slows the program +
