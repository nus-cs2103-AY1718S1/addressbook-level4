=== Enhancement Added: Shortcut Command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]]#

Users can type a shortcut command for 9 commands, where entering the first letter of the command also returns the same functionality:
1) Add
2) Delete
3) Edit
4) Find
5) History
6) List
7) Redo
8) Select
9) Undo

e.g. entering "l" will also return a list of persons in the address book

==== Justification

To make it more convenient for experienced users

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

Majority of commands have an alias, which is shorter and can also execute the command

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Shortcut implementation +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Use an alias, shortened form of the command +
**Pros:** Intuitive and easier to remember +
**Cons:** Might have overlapping aliases, requiring updates +
**Alternative 2:** Use a index for shortcuts +
**Pros:** Easier to map each command +
**Cons:** Less intuitive, and harder to remember

=== Enhancement Added: Search Command

=== External Behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.4. Listing all persons, sorted by search frequency : listByMostSearched]]#

* Users can search for contacts using the Search command and keywords. The search method will check all parameters of the user.

From this example, it can be understood that by searching Serangoon, we can see that it has listed all the people living in Serangoon, namely 'Bernice' and 'David'

==== Justification

Allows users to have a more powerful search function, which will become more useful when the address book increases in size.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

The keywords are generated as list of strings, which is then checked against the details of the persons
in address book.

The details are returned as strings, by the ReadOnlyPerson method in the person model. The list of searched
people is then continually updated, before it is finally returned to the user

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** implementation of `Search` command over `Find`  +
**Pros:** More powerful search tool +
**Cons:** Unnecessary results may be returned for larger address books
