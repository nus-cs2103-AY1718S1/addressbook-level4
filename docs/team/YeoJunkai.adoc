== Project: Sales Navigator
Sales Navigator is a desktop application built to alleviate the hassles that sales executives experience. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with Java FX. It is written in Java and was built by modifying
an existing project Address Book Level 4.

=== Enhancement Added: Events System
==== External Behaviour
'''
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=eventcrud]

==== Justification
'''
This feature is needed for the Sales Navigator as it serves as a digital log of upcoming events and meetings for a
sales executive. It is required as the foundation for many of the implemented and upcoming high-level features such as
the timetable, scheduling and tagging of events to contacts.

The implementation is done very similarly to how contacts were implemented to provide a standardised system that is
consistent throughout the application. There are some key differences between events and contacts in the ways that they
are implemented in terms of attributes, but the way that they are processed (created, removed, saved and filtered) are
largely the same.

The list of events is displayed as a list in a tabbed component together with the list of persons. It is placed there
to save space for the main panel that is used to display information for contacts and people. Similar to the person list,
cards in the list can be clicked on via the GUI to provide an intuitive user experience.

=== Enhancement Added: Timetable
==== External Behaviour
'''
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=timetable]

==== Justification
'''
The timetable's purpose is to give the user a quick view of today's events (timetable events).

Its implementation is simple as it filters out the original internal events list and stores the events (timetable events)
in its separate list in the main sales navigator memory.  Timetable events are represented by cards which vary in length
with respect to the corresponding event's duration to provide a graphical representation that is obvious to the user.
Additionally, the command to hide the timetable is implemented so as to provide more viewing room for the main panel and
increase the length of the displayed list for contacts and events.

The timetable is displayed above the main window as it is meant to catch the attention of the user especially if changes
are made to today's schedule.
