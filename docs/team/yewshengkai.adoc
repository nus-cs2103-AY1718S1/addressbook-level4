=== Enhancement Added: Find/Findany feature with prefixes

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previous behaviour of find operation does not allow user to search for other details except for their name.

This implementation enhances the usability of the application by allowing the user to utilizes different prefixes to search
for single/multiple contact or a portion of the details.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Theme

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The default address book application only support one theme which makes the address book looks dull and may not be suitable to be viewed by
user under certain circumstances (e.g. At certain time or day, or user with photophobia (light sensitivity)  might opt for brighter look and feel on the address book)

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#
---

=== Enhancement Added: Gmap

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=gmap]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previously, the application list its `Person` details using ListView. With the updated GUi, the person details will now be shown on
the left panel beside the web browser. Gmap command is hence added so that user is able to search for `Person` details other than selecting its homepage.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=gmap]

#End of Extract#
---

=== Enhancement Added: About

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=about]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

=== Enhancement Added: Remark

==== External behavior
---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=remark]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previous application utilizes tag to briefly describe their contacts. The remark enhancement allow user to leave a long string of characters that is able to describe their contact.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=remark]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Enhancement Proposed: Import/Export addressbook data to different format (e.g. .xml, .pdf, .xlxs)
---
=== Justification
User might want to print a contacts of address book in hardcopy, or export data to switch usage to other computers.
