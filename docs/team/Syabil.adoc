==== Justification

{Justify the need for, and the current design (i.e. external behavior) of, the feature}

There is a need for students to properly plan their important meetings. After the addmeeting function done by Nelson, the deletemeeting feature allows student
to delete meetings with existing contacts and to get rid of unnecessary meetings. Next, the
findmeeting command will find the meetings that the user wants to find by name of the meeting or the contact itself.
