=== Enhancement Added: Browse Panel

==== External behavior

**Aspect:** Try to make browser panel be user-friendly and looks good
**Pros:** The whole UI on browser panel looks nice and the usage of colors is decent.
**Cons:** Using external css framework takes more time to load. Some functions are hard-coded that it cannot be changed dynamically.

The Browser panel was created by HTML code, CSS and It uses front-end framework Bootstrap4.0 and raw Javascript code.
