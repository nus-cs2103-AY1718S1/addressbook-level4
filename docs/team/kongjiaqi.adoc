==== Justification
. In this application, 3W, we have taskbook as a separate entity besides addressbook so that they will not affect each other. The taskbook will thus be able to directly built besides the original addressbook without the need to modify the modelling and storage logic of the addressbook.
. Because of time constraints, the current design of the DateTime of the tasks have rigid input format. They are powerful in checking start must be earlier than end, and the validity of the start and end dates and time. Currently, we focus on the validity and security. In the future, this implementation will be extended with powerful natrual language processing unit to ensure the flexibility of input as well.
. Following the addressbook functionality, the edit task function will also be able to accept various fields (at least one filed must be present). However, the priority of the task will be updated or modified through setPriority command. This modelling will ensure the user make frequent changes to the task priority easily. The task priority currently has 5 degrees with 1 being the most important. We feel 5 degrees is the most suitable one for satisfying different business people's needs.
