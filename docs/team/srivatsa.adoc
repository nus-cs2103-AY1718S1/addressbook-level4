== Project: OurAb
OurAb is a CLI(Command Line Interface)-based desktop Address Book application written in Java, targeted at university students.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/main[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/test[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: List (with lexicographic sort)

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.3. Listing all persons : list]]#

Shows a list of all persons in the address book in alphabetical order. +
Format: `list`

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to list contacts alphabetically, for a more intuitive address book user interface.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

When the `List` command is executed, `UniquePersonList` is sorted lexicographically. +
[source,java]
----
public void sortLexicographically () {
        internalList.sort(new LexicographicComparator());
 }
----
The `LexicographicComparator` compares which person should come before another based on alphabet sequences.
This updates the address book storage file. When model calls for `filteredPersons` list, all persons are read from +
the address book storage and then displayed on `PersonListPanel` on the GUI.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Persistent sort +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Persistent sort (Sort persons, by modifying `addressbook.xml`) +
**Pros:** Reduces need for repeated sorting +
**Cons:** Unnecessary operations on storage `addressbook.xml` +
**Alternative 2:** Non-persistent sort (Sort persons in a temporary list) +
**Pros:** Reduce operations on storage file, `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Use of additional storage to copy all contacts is inefficient in terms of time & storage

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: List by most searched command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.4. Listing all persons, sorted by search frequency : listByMostSearched]]#

* When `ListByMostSearched` command is executed, a list of persons is displayed based on how frequently each person is +
searched for.

+
image::ListByMostSearchedDisplay.png[width="790"]
+

This list view is now undoable.

From this example, it can be understood that `Bernice Yu` is the most searched person, followed by `Alex Yeoh` etc.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to list contacts based on people they often connect with.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

Each successful `Find` command execution with non-zero search results, activates an update of search count for everyone in search results.+
[source,java]
----
if (searchResultsCount != NO_RESULTS) {
    model.recordSearchHistory();
}

----
This equates to an update of the search count variable within the `SearchData` class within every `Person` class.
[source,java]
----
public void incrementSearchCount()
----

When the `ListByMostSearched` is executed, `UniquePersonList` is sorted based on descending search count. +
[source,java]
----
public void sortBySearchCount () {
    internalList.sort(new ReadOnlyPersonComparator());
}
----
The `ReadOnlyPersonComparator` compares the search count between two Persons. This updates the address book storage file.+
When model calls for `filteredPersons` list, all persons are read from +
the address book storage and then displayed on `PersonListPanel` on the GUI.

//image:: Implementation Diagram.png[width="800"]

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of storage for `SearchData` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `SearchData` as a class in `Person` +
**Pros:** Increase storage efficiency +
**Cons:** `Addressbook.xml` is more complicated
**Alternative 2:** Add `SearchData` to a separate storage file +
**Pros:** Minimal changes to `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Unnecessary repetition in storage; replication of `Person` details +

---

**Aspect:** Persistent sort +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Persistent sort (Sort persons, by modifying `addressbook.xml`) +
**Pros:** Reduces need for repeated sorting & speed up `find` command +
**Cons:** Unnecessary operations on storage `addressbook.xml` +
**Alternative 2:** Non-persistent sort (Sort persons in a temporary list) +
**Pros:** Reduce operations on storage file, `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Use of additional storage to copy all contacts is inefficient in terms of time & storage

=== Enhancement Added: Delete tag Command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.8. Deleting Tags : deleteTag]]#

Deletes the specified tags from everyone in address book. +
Format: `deleteTag TAG1 TAG2 ...`

****
* Deletes all tags specified `TAG1 TAG2 ...`.
* If a particular is not used in address book, user is notified that no tag is deleted.
****

Examples:

* `deleteTag friends` +
Deletes the tag `friends` from everyone in the address book.

* `deleteTag friends colleagues` +
Deletes tags `friends` and `colleagues` from everyone in the address book.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to delete particular tags from every person on the address book.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

The specified arguments `TAG1 TAG2 ...` are parsed to generate an array of `String`.

The generated string array is then used to generate an array of type `Tag`

[source,java]
----
private Tag[] stringToTag (String[] tag);
----

Using this array of type `Tag` as parameter, the `deleteTag` method is executed as follows:

image::deleteTagModelDiagram.png[width="200"]

If `hasOneOrMoreDeletion` is true, user will be notified that tags are successfully deleted. +
Otherwise, users will be notified that specified tags are not used in address book, and thus cannot be deleted.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** implementation of `deleteTag` method in `modelManager`  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through every person & delete relevant tags +
**Pros:** Increased storage efficiency +
**Cons:** Unnecessary `remove` operations are carried out
**Alternative 2:** Populate list of people with relevant tags & delete relevant tags +
**Pros:** Fewer `remove` operations +
**Cons:** [Space complexity (O(n)) is higher] More storage elements required to store temorary lists +
**Cons:** More complex implementation

=== Enhancement Proposed: Display LinkedIn profile

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]]#

* When any of the contacts in the addressbook is selected, a list of closest LinkedIn Profiles are displayed.
* e.g When `Alex Yeoh` is selected in the panel the display to the right will show a list +
of profiles that match his details.

+
image::FindLinkedIn Profile.PNG[width="790"]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to conveniently connect with contacts in addressbook & get to know more about these contacts.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

When the `choose` command is activated with the argument `linkedin`, the `BrowserPanel` handles by calling:
[source, java]
----
private void loadOtherPages(String page);
----

image::LinkedInProfile.png[width="200"]

LinkedIn results page with parameters, such as `Name`, passed in from the selected `Person` class.

Note: Cookies are stored to maintain login session for the length of the addressbook session.

---

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of display linked in authorisation +
**Alternative 1 (current option):** Manual key in of user-id and password into browser +
**Pros:** More details of user profile is viewable +
**Pros:** More secure +
**Cons:** Tedious to type login credentials into browser +
**Alternative 2:** Use OAuth 2.0 with LinkedIn Api +
**Pros:** More convenient as login credentials are required only once +
**Cons:** LinkedIn API available does not allow for viewing of full profile +

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add meeting

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.12. Adding a new meeting command : AddMeeting]]#

Adds a new meeting to the addressbook +
Format: `addMeeting on DATE from TIME at LOCATION about NOTES [with PERSON]...`

Furthermore, every meeting added is saved locally and online on https://www.asana.com[Asana]. +
Each meeting is saved as a separate task under `Meetings` project in `Personal Projects` workspace.

[TIP]
A meeting can have more than 1 (at least 1) person associated with the meeting.

Examples:

* `add on 24/11/2017 from 1400 at Tea Party Cafe about Meetup with 1`
* `add on 12/11/2017 from 1000 at University Town about Dialogue with 2 with 3`

[NOTE]
For Asana Integration to be fully functional, make sure you have: +
* An account with Asana (Free or Premium) +
* A Workspace called `Personal Projects` (This is usually generated automatically)

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Increase user productivity by adding meetings to the addressbook & Asana. +
This helps users track their meetings easily both offline & Online. +
Furthermore, users get a friendly reminder to their inbox in all by simply adding +
meetings to ourAB.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

===== Implementation

When the command is called, the user input is parsed as shown in the sequence diagram below.

image::AddMeetingCommandLogic.png[width="800"]

In the model, there are two primary methods that are called:

1. To add unique meetings (ensured by `DuplicateMeetingException`) associated with valid people in +
addressbook (ensured by `IllegalIdException`).

[source, java]
----
    try {
        model.addMeeting(toAdd);
    } catch (DuplicateMeetingException e) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MEETING);
    } catch (IllegalIdException ive) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_ID);
    }
----

2. To post a task on Asana
[source, java]
----
    newAsanaTask = new PostTask(toAdd.getNotes(), toAdd.getDate());
    newAsanaTask.execute();
----

Create a new instance of `PostTask` and authenticate user using https://github.com/Asana/java-asana[OAuth2].

===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Post on Asana +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Incorporate posting on Asana with every addCommand +
**Pros:** Convenient for user to keep track of tasks related to meetings +
**Cons:** Reduces control that user has in uploading tasks to Asana+
**Alternative 2:** Create a separate command to add tasks onto Asana +
**Pros:** More flexibility on the content that is saved onto Asana workspace +
**Cons:** Unnecessary number of commands in the addressbook & reduce productivity of user

=== Other contributions

==== Implemented ReadOnlyMeeting class

In an effort to be more defensive while programming, the addressbook application uses `ReadOnlyMeeting` instead of the +
easily modifiable `Meeting` class. This is similar to the idea of using `ReadOnlyPerson` class whenever possible in +
place of the `Person` class directly. This ensures fewer errors by restricting unnecessary modifications to the `Meeting` +
class.

==== Added SearchCount parameter to Person Class

Each person has now an associated `searchCount` variable that keeps track of the number each person is searched for.

==== Project Management

* Assigned issues to teammates
* Monitored progress and created milestones of the team
* Constantly reviewed if users' needs were considered
