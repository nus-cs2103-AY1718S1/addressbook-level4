== Project: OurAb
OurAb is a CLI(Command Line Interface)-based desktop Address Book application written in Java, targeted at university students.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/main[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/test[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: List (with lexicographic sort)

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.3. Listing all persons : list]]#

Shows a list of all persons in the address book in alphabetical order. +
Format: `list`

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to list contacts alphabetically, for a more intuitive address book user interface.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

When the `List` command is executed, `UniquePersonList` is sorted lexicographically. +
[source,java]
----
public void sortLexicographically () {
        internalList.sort(new LexicographicComparator());
 }
----
The `LexicographicComparator` compares which person should come before another based on alphabet sequences.
This updates the address book storage file. When model calls for `filteredPersons` list, all persons are read from +
the address book storage and then displayed on `PersonListPanel` on the GUI.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Persistent sort +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Persistent sort (Sort persons, by modifying `addressbook.xml`) +
**Pros:** Reduces need for repeated sorting +
**Cons:** Unnecessary operations on storage `addressbook.xml` +
**Alternative 2:** Non-persistent sort (Sort persons in a temporary list) +
**Pros:** Reduce operations on storage file, `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Use of additional storage to copy all contacts is inefficient in terms of time & storage

=== Enhancement Added: List by most searched command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.4. Listing all persons, sorted by search frequency : listByMostSearched]]#

* When `ListByMostSearched` command is executed, a list of persons is displayed based on how frequently each person is +
searched for.

+

+

From this example, it can be understood that `Alex Yeoh` is the most searched person, followed by `David Li` etc.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to list contacts based on people they often connect with.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

Each successful `Find` command execution with non-zero search results, activates an update of search count for everyone in search results.+
[source,java]
----
if (searchResultsCount != NO_RESULTS) {
    model.recordSearchHistory();
}

----
This equates to an update of the search count variable within the `SearchData` class within every `Person` class.
[source,java]
----
public void incrementSearchCount()
----

When the `ListByMostSearched` is executed, `UniquePersonList` is sorted based on descending search count. +
[source,java]
----
public void sortBySearchCount () {
    internalList.sort(new ReadOnlyPersonComparator());
}
----
The `ReadOnlyPersonComparator` compares the search count between two Persons. This updates the address book storage file.+
When model calls for `filteredPersons` list, all persons are read from +
the address book storage and then displayed on `PersonListPanel` on the GUI.

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of storage for `SearchData` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `SearchData` as a class in `Person` +
**Pros:** Increase storage efficiency +
**Cons:** `Addressbook.xml` is more complicated
**Alternative 2:** Add `SearchData` to a separate storage file +
**Pros:** Minimal changes to `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Unnecessary repetition in storage; replication of `Person` details +

---

**Aspect:** Persistent sort +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Persistent sort (Sort persons, by modifying `addressbook.xml`) +
**Pros:** Reduces need for repeated sorting & speed up `find` command +
**Cons:** Unnecessary operations on storage `addressbook.xml` +
**Alternative 2:** Non-persistent sort (Sort persons in a temporary list) +
**Pros:** Reduce operations on storage file, `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Use of additional storage to copy all contacts is inefficient in terms of time & storage

=== Enhancement Added: Delete tag Command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.8. Deleting Tags : deleteTag]]#

Deletes the specified tags from everyone in address book. +
Format: `deleteTag TAG1 TAG2 ...`

****
* Deletes all tags specified `TAG1 TAG2 ...`.
* If a particular is not used in address book, user is notified that no tag is deleted.
****

Examples:

* `deleteTag friends` +
Deletes the tag `friends` from everyone in the address book.

* `deleteTag friends colleagues` +
Deletes tags `friends` and `colleagues` from everyone in the address book.

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows users to delete particular tags from every person on the address book.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

The specified arguments `TAG1 TAG2 ...` are parsed to generate an array of `String`.

The generated string array is then used to generate an array of type `Tag`

[source,java]
----
private Tag[] stringToTag (String[] tag);
----

Using this array of type `Tag` as parameter, the `deleteTag` method is executed as follows:

image::deleteTagModelDiagram.png[width="200"]

If `hasOneOrMoreDeletion` is true, user will be notified that tags are successfully deleted. +
Otherwise, users will be notified that specified tags are not used in address book, and thus cannot be deleted.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** implementation of `deleteTag` method in `modelManager`  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through every person & delete relevant tags +
**Pros:** Increased storage efficiency +
**Cons:** Unnecessary `remove` operations are carried out
**Alternative 2:** Populate list of people with relevant tags & delete relevant tags +
**Pros:** Fewer `remove` operations +
**Cons:** [Space complexity (O(n)) is higher] More storage elements required to store temorary lists +
**Cons:** More complex implementation

=== Enhancement Proposed: Find LinkedIn Contact

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]]#

* When any of the contacts in the addressbook is selected, their LinkedIn Profile is displayed.
* e.g When `Alex Yeoh` is selected in the panel the display to the right will show his Linkedin profile.
+

==== Justification

Allows users to conveniently connect with contacts in addressbook.

==== Implementation
