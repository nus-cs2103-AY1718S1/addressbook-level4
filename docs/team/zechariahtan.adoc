== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
AB&B is a desktop Address Book application created by Team T10-B3 in AY2017/8 Semester 1 as a CS2103T Software Engineering project. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

This application has a GUI but most user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface), making it ideal for users who can type fast. The current features are selectively implemented to cater to administrative users.

The objective of this portfolio is to document notable contributions I have made to the application.

=== Enhancement Added: New fields NOK Name & NOK Phone

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Next-of-Kin details are useful for administration in places like schools or tuition centres.

=== Enhancement Added: Optional Fields

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Sometimes it's inappropriate to ask people such as colleagues for their personal details such as Address, Email & Next-of-Kin details. Thus such details can be left blank.

=== Enhancement Added: Address Book Backup

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allows the user to make a backup before making any major changes to the address book's data.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Make NOK Name and NOK Phone coupled together

It does not make sense to have NOK Name without NOK Phone and vice versa.
