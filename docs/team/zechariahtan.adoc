== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
AB&B is a desktop Address Book application created by Team T10-B3 in AY2017/8 Semester 1 as a CS2103T Software Engineering project. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

This application has a GUI but most user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface), making it ideal for users who can type fast. The current features are selectively implemented to cater to administrative users.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Make NOK Name and NOK Phone coupled together
