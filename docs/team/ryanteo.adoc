== Project: AB&B
AB&B is a java-based address book application. The application allows the user to easily manage his/her
contacts' information. Although there is a GUI, main interactions from the user are done via CLI.
While there are features which benefit the generic user, the team has included features tailored specifically
for administrative personnel.

The objective of this portfolio is to document notable contributions I have made to the application.
A record of my contributions towards other similar projects can be found towards the end of the document.

=== Enhancement Added: Deletion by Name

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletebyname]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

To allow users to easily delete a contact with their name instead of having to scroll
through the displayed person list to obtain the corresponding index. It also provides
some time saving benefits by integrating a `find` function with the deletion query in
the event that the user cannot recall the exact name of the contact to delete.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=DeleteByNameCommand]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Export to CSV

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

To allow users to easily make use of the data stored in AB&B with other applications. An example
would be to upload the CSV file into an email client as a quick and simple way to mass update
email addresses.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Ability to suggest frequently accessed contacts

Users may need to frequently look up a particular contact for numerous reasons. By having such a feature,
it would save them time and effort if AB&B were able to suggest or prioritise frequently
accessed contacts in the displayed person list.
