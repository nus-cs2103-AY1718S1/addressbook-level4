=== Enhancement Added: Google Maps Browser

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=browser]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since Ark is meant to assist in deliveries, it is necessary for Ark to have a Google Maps browser implemented
within the application to show to users the exact location of parcel delivery addresses.
This would enable our users to continue using Ark without the need to keep switching between our application
and a web browser, thus saving users time and hassle.

=== Enhancement Added: Tab Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tabCommand]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since Ark has 4 different statuses for parcels, it is essential that our users are able to quickly
navigate between the different statuses. Hence we have implemented different parcelLists for undelivered and delivered
parcels. These lists are viewed in separate tabs in the parcelListPanel.
To improve usability for users of Ark to be able to quickly search between the different parcel statuses
without the need for a mouse, a `tab` command is required.

=== Enhancement Added: Overdue Parcels Popup Window

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=overduePopup]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since our application is meant to be used as a parcel manager, it is important that our users
know when they have overdue parcels. Since these parcels are either late for delivery or possibly
missing, it is important to notify the users of these overdue parcels. A popup window right at the
startup of the Ark application is the best way to notify users since it would be the first thing
users see whenever they startup Ark.
