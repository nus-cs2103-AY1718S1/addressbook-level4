=== Enhancement Added: Birthdate Field/Tab

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=birthday]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification
It is extremely useful and intuitive for an address book application to keep track of a contact's birthday information.
After all, birthday celebrations are one of the most significant reasons why people gather together and socialise.

By displaying contacts sorted by upcoming birthdays, the user can see at one glance which friend has an upcoming
birthday celebration which may require his attention.

By highlighting a contact whose birthday is today, this further brings the immediacy of this event to the user's attention,
prompting him to take necessary action.

==== Justification

Instagram is arguably the most used social media platform today, at least in the student community. Students are a
big part of our target audience, and a quick means for our user to access a friend's Instagram profile page is extremely
beneficial to his social needs.
