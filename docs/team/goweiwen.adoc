`UNIFY` is a Command Line Interface AddressBook that helps users manage your contacts efficiently. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

=== Enhancement Added: Alias

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=alias]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Aliases help users execute commands they might forget. For example, if the user can't remember how to
add a new contact to the address book, they can type any of `add`, `create`, or `new`. In addition,
we allow users to define their own aliases if the default ones are not memorable enough.

We do not provide short-form aliases (e.g. `a` as an alias for `add`) by default as we feel having a
powerful autocompletion feature completely eclipses any uses for cryptic short-form commands. If the
user feels short-form aliases are required, they can add them themselves.

=== Enhancement Added: Command Box Validation

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=inline-hints]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

In order to familiarise new users to the command-line interface, we validate commands as the users type.
This allows them to know if their commands are incorrect before they press enter. This is only helpful
for users able to touch-type. As our target audience is computing students, we can safely assume a majority
of the users will benefit from this feature.

=== Enhancement Added: Command Box Icon

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=inline-hints]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

As with input validation, this feature is introduced to give users a hint of what their command will
do, before they execute it. Besides helping users use the command-line more effectively, it also helps
to make the user interface more polished, as these icons are present in most search boxes (e.g. internet
browsers display the page's icon, macOS's Spotlight displays the application's icon).

=== Enhancement Added: Autocomplete

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

{Justify the need for, and the current design (i.e. external behavior) of, the feature}

=== Enhancement Proposed: History Substring Search

Currently, when pressing `Up` or `Down` in the command box, we can cycle through our previously typed
commands, irregardless of what is typed in the command box. One possible enhancement is changing it so
it only cycles through commands that contain whatever is in the command box as a substring (i.e. like
link:https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search[zsh-history-substring-search]).

=== Enhancement Proposed: Composite Aliases

The alias feature currently implemented only allows users to create aliases for one partial or full
command. One possible enhancement is to allow users to delimit commands in their aliases with semicolons,
like: `alias delete3 delete 1; delete 1; delete 1`. This will allow users to perform repetitive tasks
quickly, with just one command.
