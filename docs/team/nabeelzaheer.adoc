== Project: The Classroom
The Classroom is a desktop address book application designed to specifically cater to students to manage their contacts.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, has a GUI created with JavaFX and is wriitten in Java.

The Classroom is equipped with features and functionalities aimed to facilitate in effectively managing contacts'
details as well as tasks that they may share with them which is represented  in the application in the form of remarks.

This portfolio page aims to highlight features that have been enhanced or introduced to meet the needs of students and
further push the capabilities of the application towards total user-customisation. Additionally, extracts of the User and Developer Guide are
included to further illustrate the implementation and execution of these features.

==== Justification

The feature to add and remove tags in the application is crucial not only as an added functionality of the application but
also as a practical use for users. As our audience is targeted towards students who in a form or another will be involved in
group projects, the above mentioned feature is implemented to cater to this particular aspect of our target audience by allowing them to
organise contacts based on their different groups and associations.

Furthermore, the current design of this feature is such that it allows versatility on how the feature is executed.
For instance, users can provide a range of index from which a tags are to be removed. Such versatility in performance
attest to the vision of the project which is to effectively manage contacts through extensive user-customisations.

=== Enhancement Added: Find persons

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

As the contact list continues to be populated, it would be a challenge to keep track of the indexes to execute commands.
Thus, with the find command, users are able to view a filtered list and execute commands easily. Additionally, the
versatility of the find feature in accepting various fields gives user more options and usability.

Furthermore, besides allowing multiple fields to be accepted in the command mechanism, partial keyword inputs are also allowed.
This aspect of the feature further establishes its finding capability as well as its practicality. This is due to the
fact that there are instances that users may only remember a a first letter of a name or just the first 3 digits of the phone
number. As a result, this capability of the feature in accepting partial inputs would definitely be of great use for users.
Moreover, efforts in ensuring user-friendliness for this feature was also considered in its design. Users need not repeatedly
type a `PREFIX` before every keyword belonging to the same field. Instead, users are allowed to provide inputs of the
same field in a sentence and only specify the `PREFIX` once, preceding the sentence.

=== Enhancement Proposed:

* For the `Find` feature of the application, a mechanism can be implemented to *highlight* keywords specified keywords
in the filtered list of the results as shown in the screenshot below. +

#End of Extract#

* Implement a scheduling feature to allow user to keep track of personal tasks and act as a reminder by incorporating
the Clock and Date aspect.
