=== Enhancement Added: Favorite Status in the Person Model

==== External behavior

---
#Start of extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=favorite]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Allow users to mark or unmark contacts whom they are closer with as their favorites. Favorites contact have a "star" badge attached to them so that users can find and identify these people more easily. This enhancement allows toggling of such favorite status via `add` and `edit` commands. This would also later come to be integrated with the `Favorite` and `Unfavorite` commands as well as `Sort` command (done by my teammate Marvin) which allows displaying of favorite contacts at the top of the contacts list by default.

=== Enhancement Added: User Interface Overhaul and Theme Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Redesigned the application to provide a cleaner, sleeker and fresher look that would drive a better visual appeal. Also added two polished themes - day and night - which are simplistic with a hint of mordenity to allow user to personalise their application to suit their liking. Day theme presents a light-colored theme suitable for users who prefer brighter design with less contrast while night theme presents a dark-colored theme suitable for users who prefer a dimmer design with higher contrast. Both themes uses subtle shades of colors that enhance visual controls such as command and result box and places more emphasis on each contact card.

Custom fonts such as Open Sans and Segoe UI font family were embedded into the application to achieve consistent typography across different platforms such as Windows and macOS.

Implemented random bright color generator using golden ratio to achieve even distribution for coloring of tag labels and display photo thumbnails.

Theme command allows user to switch between the two aforementioned themes easily especially using command alias e.g. `t -night`.
