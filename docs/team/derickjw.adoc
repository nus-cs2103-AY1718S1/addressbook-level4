== Project: H.M.U
H.M.U is a software to help people manage their contacts easily. Apart from the basic features of an address book, H.M.U specializes in scheduling. This is done by allowing the user to schedule meetings through the user of the application. Furthermore, users will be able to find the most convenient meeting spot with the help of the application, by taking into account the contact's nearest MRT station.

H.M.U cares about the security of its users as well. As such, users have to login with a username or password to continue using the app.
