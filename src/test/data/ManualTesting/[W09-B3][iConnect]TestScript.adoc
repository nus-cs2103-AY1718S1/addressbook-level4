== Loading of sample data file
The sample data file `[W09-B3][iConnect]SampleData.xml` is inside the `ManualTesting` folder, the same folder with this test script. +

. Create a new empty folder named `data` within the same folder with `iConnect.jar` file.
. Copy the sample data file into the `data` folder.
. Rename the data file as `addressbook.xml`.

== Explanation on user interface

. The menu bar on top contains `File`, `Help`, and `Style`. You can choose three different themes under `Style`.
. The panel on the left shows a list of contacts inside the address book.
. The centre panel contains a tab view with the first tab showing person details, followed by a browser tab and lastly a recycle bin tab.
. The social media icons on the person details page are clickable, and opens up a new tab linking to its default page (personalised link will be available in v2.0).
. The panel on the right shows an interactive calendar with an event list panel below it.
. Dates which are greyed-out are clickable and events on the selected date will appear on the top of the event list.
