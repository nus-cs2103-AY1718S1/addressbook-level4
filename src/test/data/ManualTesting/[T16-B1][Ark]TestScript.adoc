== Introduction
Ark is a parcel delivery management system to help delivery companies manage their parcels and their
deliveries. This test script is used help testers perform manual testing of Ark.

== Quick Start



== Features to Test

=== Startup Tests
We have implemented some features that triggered automatically on startup.

==== Manual Testing

*Description:* On startup, if there are any parcels found with the OVERDUE status in the uncompleted parcel list
it will cause a popup window notifying the user of the number of OVERDUE parcels. +
*Input:* - +
*Expected output:* For the sample data xml file. A popup window with the title of "Important" will appear over the main window of the Ark application.
The content header will read "Overdue Parcels" and the content text will show
"You have parcels whose status are overdue\n Number of overdue parcels: 5"

*Description:* No popup window should show if there are no OVERDUE parcels +
*Input:* `clear` and close the application. Reopen the application again. +
*Expected output:* There should be no popup window.

*Description:* Startup automatically updates the status of parcels according to their date in Gui. +
*Input:* - +
*Expected output:* Download a new copy of the sample data. Check that the parcels in the newly downloaded
copy have had their Status updated in the running instance of Ark. (Update for PENDING and OVERDUE)

*Description:* Startup also saves the updated Status into the main storage file. +
*Input:* - +
*Expected output:* Open the original file that you used as the storage of this running instance.
Observe that the parcels in the save file will also updated Status. +

*Description:* Backup file stores the originals. +
*Input:* The backup file will be called `[T16-B1][Ark]SampleData.xml-backup.xml`. It is in the same directory
 as your main storage file. Open this file. +
*Expected output:* Observe that the parcels are not updated. Also observe that it is the same
as the new storage file that you had downloaded previously.

*Description:* Backup file does not backup if there is no storage file to read. +
*Input:* (Copy your Ark.jar into an empty folder (without any save files). +
*Expected output:* No backup is created. +

=== Switching Tabs
Command format: `tab (TAB_INDEX)`. E.g. `tab 2` +
Description: This command allows you to switch between parcel list tabs. There are two tabs, one for all uncompleted parcels, index 1, and completed parcels, index 2.

Alternatively, you can also click on the tabs to switch to the clicked tab.

==== Manual Testing
*Description:* Changing tabs normally +
*Input:* `tab 2` +
*Expected output:* Ark should switch you to the 2nd tab, Completed Parcels. +

*Description:* Switching to a tab that is not there +
*Input:* `tab 3` +
*Expected output:* The results display will show “Invalid Tab Number” +

*Description:* Inputting a non number +
*Input:* `tab a` +
*Expected output:* The results display will show “Invalid command format” +

*Description:* Not inputting an argument +
*Input:* `tab` +
*Expected output:* The results display will show “Invalid command format” +

*Description:* Adding a parcel meant for the completed list while currently on the all parcels tab +
*Input:* `tab 1` -> `add (any valid parcel with a COMPLETED status)` +
*Expected output:* Ark will automatically switch to the completed parcels tab and select the newly added parcel. +

=== List Command
Command format: `list`
Description: This command will expand the parcel list panel in Ark. The list will minimize back whenever `add` or `edit` commands are entered.

You can also drag the split pane divider around to change the sizes of the list panel. However they will go back to their set defaults sizes after `add` , `edit` , `list` , `select` , `delete` commands.

==== Manual Testing
*Description:* Getting the list to minimize and then show  +
*Input:* `select 1` -> `list` +
*Expected output:* The list should minimize after the `select` command and expand back again after the `list` command +

*Description:* Adding a parcel while the list is maximized +
*Input:* `list` -> `add (any valid parcel)` +
*Expected output:* The list should maximize after the `list` command and the list should minimize and select the newly added parcel after the `add` command.+

*Description:* editing a parcel while the list is maximized +
*Input:* `list` -> `edit (any valid index) n/new name` +
*Expected output:* The list should maximize after the `list` command and the list should minimize and select the newly edited parcel after the `edit` command. The edited parcel should now display “new name”. +

=== Select Command
Command format: `select (PARCEL_INDEX)`. e.g. `select 1` to select the first parcel in the parcel list.
Description: This command allows you to select any parcel in the parcel list of the current tab. If the parcel list is currently maximized, it will minimize the list to show the browser panel. The browser will show the google maps search of the postal code of the selected parcel.

==== Manual Testing
*Description:* Selecting a parcel when the list is maximized +
*Input:* `list` -> `select (any valid index)` +
*Expected output:* After selecting a parcel, the list will minimize to show the browser. The browser will show the google maps search of the postal code of the selected parcel.  +

*Description:* Selecting a parcel when the list is minimized +
*Input:* `select (any valid index)` +
*Expected output:* After selecting a parcel, the browser will show the google maps search of the postal code of the selected parcel. The list remains minimized.  +

*Description:* To select a parcel in different tabs, you need to be in that tab first +
*Input:* `tab 2` -> `select (any valid index)` -> `tab 1` -> `select (any valid index)` +
*Expected output:* After switching to the completed parcels tab, selecting a parcel will select the indexed parcel of that tab. After switching back to the first tab and selecting another parcel, it will instead select the indexed parcel from the first tab. +

=== Import Command

Command format: `import (FILE_NAME)`. e.g. `import ark_save` +
Description: This command allows you to add multiple parcels from a valid Ark storage file that is stored
 in the `./data/import/` directory. e.g. `import ark_save` will import `./data/import/ark_save.xml`. +
Presently, Ark only supports `.xml` storage files in format. +

Before you use test command, copy the following sample `.xml` files into Ark: +

* [T16-B1][Ark]ark_save.xml
* [T16-B1][Ark]empty.xml
* [T16-B1][Ark]notXmlFormatAddressBook.xml

==== Manual Testing

*Description:* Regular import. +
*Input:* `import ark_save` +
*Expected output:* Ark should add the new parcels into the running instance of Ark. Duplicate parcels are ignored.
Duplicate parcels are parcels with the same details (every detail except Status and Tag is used for comparison).
Non-duplicate parcels are added. Ark should display of parcels added and parcels that are not added in the results box. +

*Description:*  Import the save file (will contain duplicate parcels now). +
*Input:* `import [T16-B1][Ark]ark_save` +
*Expected output:* Ark should warn you that all parcels in the save file are duplicate parcels. Nothing happens. +

*Description:* Importing an empty save file +
*Input:* `import [T16-B1][Ark]empty` +
*Expected output:* Ark should warn you that the file you want to import is empty.

*Description:* Importing a empty file that is not in a valid Ark save file format+
*Input:* `import [T16-B1][Ark]notXmlFormatArk` +
*Expected output:* Ark should give you details on how the import command should be used and inform you that
the file is not in a valid format. +

*Description:* Appending .xml to the file +
*Input:* `import [T16-B1][Ark]ark_save.xml` +
*Expected output:* Ark should give you details on how the import command should be used and inform you that
 the file should be a valid xml storage file that follows a naming convention of only underscores and
 alphanumeric characters. +

*Description:* Importing a missing file. +
*Input:* `import random` +
*Expected output:* Ark should inform you that the file cannot be found. +

*Description:* Importing a file with non-alphanumeric characters +
*Input:* `import ../hi` +
*Expected output:* Ark should give you details on how the import command should be used and inform you that
the file should be a valid xml storage file that follows a naming convention of only underscores and
alphanumeric characters. +

*Description:* Undo import command +
*Input:* `undo` +
*Expected output:* Previously imported files should be removed.

*Description:* Redo import command +
*Input:* `redo` +
*Expected output:* Redo previous command import command.

*Description:* Import command removes selection of previous panel +
*Input:* `undo` -> `select (any valid index)` -> `import [T16-B1][Ark]ark_save` +
*Expected output:* Import command removes the selection in the list but browser panel remains unchanged.
