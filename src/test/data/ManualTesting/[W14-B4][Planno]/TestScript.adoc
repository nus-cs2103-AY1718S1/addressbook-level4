== About

This test script contains step by step instructions for the manual testing of Planno.
It is segmented into sections, the first of which contains instructions on how to load the sample data.
Each section that follows contains step by step instructions on how to proceed with testing the command.

[NOTE]
The expected results for the commands in this test scripts assumes that the commands are tested from a freshly loaded and clean sample data (No modification from base sample data).
Any changes may cause differences between the expected and actual result.

== Setting up the sample data

.  Download the latest `Planno.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Move the jar file to an empty folder.
.  Double-click the file to start the app.
.  Type `clear` to remove all data.
.  Close the app.
.  Open the data folder - You will notice there are 2 files:
`addressbook.xml` and `eventstorage.xml`.
.  Open the xml files (including `sampledata.xml`) with notepad or any other text editing tool.
.  `sampledata.xml` contains comments indicating the start and end of the sampledata for both files in step 6.
Copy and paste the sample data into its respective file.
.  Save the changes.
.  Start the app. The sample data will be loaded and reflected in the GUI.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try some sample commands:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app
+
[NOTE]
For the details of each command, please refer to Features section.
+
.  Congratulations! If you can run Planno without any trouble, you can start trying this application. Otherwise, Please refer to FAQ and solve your problems.

== Features

=== General

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Command key wards are *case sensitive*. e.g. only `help` means help command, while `HELP`, `HElp`, `hElP` are not.
