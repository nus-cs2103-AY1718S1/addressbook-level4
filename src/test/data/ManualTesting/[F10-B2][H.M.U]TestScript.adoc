=== Prerequisites

. Have Java (JRE) version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest release `[F10-B2][H.M.U].jar`, the sample data `[F10-B2][H.M.U]SampleData.xml` and test instructions
`[F10-B2][H.M.U]TestScript.pdf` (this document itself).
. A folder you want to use as home folder for testing **H.M.U** and copy the `.jar` you have downloaded there.

=== Importing the Sample Data

. Rename the downloaded `[F10-B2][H.M.U]SampleData.xml` to `addressbook.xml`.
. Create a folder called `data` under the home folder used for testing **H.M.U**.
. Move `addressbook.xml` into the `data` folder created just now.

== Testing

=== Add/view/edit/delete contacts

==== Add a new contact

To add a new contact, we need to use the `add` command.

*Positive test case*

Let's add a new person called `Martin` into *H.M.U* +
_Command:_ +
`add n/Martin Smith p/85930167 e/martin.smith@example.com a/25 Scene Road, 119587 m/Kent Ridge t/friends` +
_Result:_ +
`New person added: Martin Smith Phone: 85930167 Email: martin.smith@example.com Address: 25 Scene Road, 119587 Mrt Station: Kent Ridge Tags: [friends]`

*Negative test cases*

. The value for one property is invalid +
_Command:_ +
`add n/Den Smith p/85930167 e/www.smith.com a/25 New York City m/Pasir Ris` +
_Result:_ +
`Person emails should be 2 alphanumeric/period strings separated by '@'`

. The person already exists +
_Command:_ +
`add n/Martin Smith p/85930167 e/martin.smith@example.com a/25 Scene Road, 119587 m/Kent Ridge t/friends` +
_Result:_ +
`This person already exists in the application.`

==== Edit an existing contact

To edit an existing contact, we need to use the `edit` command.

*Positive test case*

. First, let's list all the contacts +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Let's edit the person called `Martin` we added just now (assume the index is `8`) +
_Command:_ +
`edit 1 p/86129854` +
_Result:_ +
`Edited Person: Alex Yeoh Phone: 86129854 Email: alexyeoh@example.com Address: Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40 Mrt Station: Kallang Tags: [friends]`

*Negative test cases*

. The index is invalid (assume there are fewer than 100 contacts in the application) +
_Command:_ +
`edit 100 a/LA` +
_Result:_ +
`The person index provided is invalid.`

==== View the details of a person

To view the details of an existing contact, we need to use the `select` command.

. First, let's list all the contacts  +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Then, select the person we want to view (assume there is at least 1 contact in the application) +
_Command:_ +
`select 1` +
_Result:_ +
The person's details will be shown on the right-hand side of the interface.

==== Delete an existing person

To delete an existing contact, we need to use the `delete` command.

. First, let's list all the contacts +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Then, delete the first person (assume there is at least 1 contact in the application) +
_Command:_ +
`delete 1` +
_Result:_ +
`Deleted Person: Alex Yeoh Phone: 87438807 Email: alexyeoh@example.com Address: Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40 Tags: [friends]`


==== Add, Clear and visualize the schedule to an existing person



. First, let's list all the contacts +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Add schedule to a person +
_Command:_ +
`addSchedule 1 d/Monday st/0800 et/1000` +
_Result:_ +
`Free time slot successfully added`

. Visualize schedule of a person +
_Command:_ +
`visualize 1` +
_Result:_ +
`Visualized Success! 1`
and shows all free time slots in the ui as well as the console.

. Clear schedule of a person +
_Command:_ +
`clearSchedule 1 d/Monday st/0930 et/1000` +
_Result:_ +
`Schedule successfully cleared`

. Visualize schedule of a person +
_Command:_ +
`visualize 1` +
_Result:_ +
`Visualized Success! 1`
and shows all free time slots in the ui as well as the console. +
Note that the free time slot is cleared from 9:30 to 10:00.

==== Arrange a meeting schedule for a list of people

To arrange a meeting slot we need to use the `arrange` command.
Let's configure some schedule first: +
`addSchedule 1 d/Monday st/0800 et/1000` +
`addSchedule 2 d/Monday st/0900 et/1000` +
`addSchedule 3 d/Monday st/0600 et/0930` +
`addSchedule 4 d/Monday st/0900 et/1800` +
`addSchedule 1 d/Saturday st/0800 et/1000` +
`addSchedule 2 d/Saturday st/0900 et/1000` +
`addSchedule 3 d/Saturday st/0600 et/0930` +
`addSchedule 4 d/Saturday st/0900 et/1800` +
Then, `arrange 1 2 3 4` will only show Monday and Saturday 9:00-9:30 as common slots.

==== Login feature

To create a default account, the user needs to type in `createDefaultAcc`
The default user name and password are all "admin". +

To remove this account, one needs to type `removeLogin username password`
e.g `removeLogin admin admin`
_Result:_ +
`Login removed successfully` +

Again, we create the login feature `createDefaultAcc`. +
Let's say the password is to be changed to `123456`. +
Another command, `changepw` is to be used here. +
_Command:_ +
`changepw admin password newpassword` +
then `newpassword` is the password for account admin now. +
If the user wants to change the user name, he can call +
`changeuser admin user newpassword` and the account name is admin now. +

==== Looking for an existing contact

To look for a specific contact we can use the comprehensive find command to do so.


*Positive test case*

. First, let's list all the contacts +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Let's try to find the contacts that satisfy any of the conditions of the command.
_Command:_ +
`find OR n/John e/johndoe t/friend` +
Will result in all the contacts with the name John, the email johndoe or a friend of the user listed.

. Let's try to find the contacts that satisfy all of the conditions of the command.
_Command:_ +
`find AND n/John e/johndoe t/friend` +
only one person is listed.

==== Undo/redo previous commands

Use `undo` or `redo` to undo/redo the last command entered.
