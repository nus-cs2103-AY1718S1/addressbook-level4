. Rename the "SampleData.xml" to "addressbook.xml"
. Run touristbook.jar

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Marina Bay Sands`.
* Items in square brackets are OPTIONAL e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Marina Bay Sands t/attractions` or as `n/Marina Bay Sands`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/attractions`, `t/onestar t/twostars` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `a/ADDRESS n/NAME` is also acceptable.
