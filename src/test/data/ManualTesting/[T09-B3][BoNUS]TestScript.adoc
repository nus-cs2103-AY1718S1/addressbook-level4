_Figure 1 : User Interface Demo_

=== Prerequisites

. Have Java (JRE) version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest release `[T09-B3][BoNUS].jar`, the sample data `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` and test instructions
`[T09-B3][BoNUS]TestScript.pdf` (this document itself).
. A folder you want to use as home folder for testing **BoNUS** and copy the `.jar` you have downloaded there.

=== Importing the Sample Data

. Rename the downloaded `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` to `addressbook.xml`.
. Create a folder called `data` under the home folder used for testing **BoNUS**.
. Move `addressbook.xml` into the `data` folder created just now.

=== Troubleshooting

If you have any doubt or need further clarification, you may want to visit our https://cs2103aug2017-t09-b3.github.io/main/[project website]
for more information.

== Testing

=== Add/view/edit/delete contacts

==== Add a new contact

To add a new contact, we need to use the `add` command.

==== Add avatar to an existing person

To add avatar to a contact, we need to use the `avatar` command.

. First, let's list all the contacts in *BoNUS* +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Then move an image file (`.jpg` or `.png`) into the home folder where you use *BoNUS*

. Add avatar to the third person in the listing (assume there are at least three contacts) +
_Command:_ +
`avatar 3 someImage.jpg`

=== Add/view/edit/delete events

==== Listing of events
*Positive test case* +
_Command:_ +
`listE` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all events`

You should see that the application automatically switches from contact list to event list after the command listE.


*Negative test case* +
_Command:_ +
`ListE` +
_Result:_ +
`Unknown command` +
_Command:_ +
`lIsTE` +
_Result:_ +
`Unknown command`

Commands are case sensitive.


==== Adding of events

To add an event, we need to use addE n/NAME dt/DATE_TIME a/ADDRESS of the event.

1) Adds a new event with Name `CS3201 Project Meeting`, DateTime `17112017 1530`, Address `School of Computing, SR09, NUS`


_Command:_ +
`addE n/CS3201 Project Meeting dt/17112017 15:30 a/School Of Computing, SR09, NUS` +
_Result:_ +
`New event added:  Event: CS3201 Project Meeting |  Date/Time: 17 Nov, 2017 15:30 |  Address: School Of Computing, SR09, NUS`


2) Adds a new event with Name `CS1231 Project Meeting`, DateTime `19112017 15:30`, Address `School of Computing, DR1, NUS` +

`addE n/CS1231 Project Meeting dt/19112017 15:30 a/School Of Computing, DR1, NUS` +
_Result:_ +
`New event added:  Event: CS1231 Project Meeting |  Date/Time: 19 Nov, 2017 15:30 |  Address: School of Computing, DR1, NUS`
