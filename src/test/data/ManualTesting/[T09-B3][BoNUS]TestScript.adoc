_Figure 1 : User Interface Demo_

=== Prerequisites

. Have Java (JRE) version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest release `[T09-B3][BoNUS].jar`, the sample data `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` and test instructions
`[T09-B3][BoNUS]TestScript.pdf` (this document itself).
. A folder you want to use as home folder for testing **BoNUS** and copy the `.jar` you have downloaded there.

=== Importing the Sample Data

. Rename the downloaded `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` to `addressbook.xml`.
. Create a folder called `data` under the home folder used for testing **BoNUS**.
. Move `addressbook.xml` into the `data` folder created just now.

=== Troubleshooting

If you have any doubt or need further clarification, you may want to visit our https://cs2103aug2017-t09-b3.github.io/main/[project website]
for more information.

== Testing

=== Add/view/edit/delete contacts

==== Add a new contact

To add a new contact, we need to use the `add` command.

*Positive test case*

Let's add a new person called `Martin` into *BoNUS* +
_Command:_ +
`add n/Martin Smith p/85930167 e/martin.smith@example.com a/25 Scene Road, 119587 t/friends`
_Result:_ +
`New person added: Martin Smith Phone: 85930167 Email: martin.smith@example.com Address: 25 Scene Road, 119587 Tags: [friends]`

*Negative test cases*

. The value for one property is invalid +
_Command:_ +
`add n/Den Smith p/85930167 e/www.smith.com a/25 New York City`
_Result:_ +
`Person emails should be 2 alphanumeric/period strings separated by '@'.`

. The person already exists +
_Command:_ +
`add n/Martin Smith p/85930167 e/martin.smith@example.com a/25 Scene Road, 119587 t/friends`
_Result:_ +
`This person already exists in the application.`

==== Edit an existing contact

To edit an existing contact, we need to use the `edit` command.

*Positive test case*

. First, let's list all the contacts in *BoNUS* +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Let's edit the person called `Martin` we added just now (assume the index is `8`) +
_Command:_ +
`edit 8 p/86129854`
_Result:_ +
`Edited Person: Martin Smith Phone: 86129854 Email: martin.smith@example.com Address: 25 Scene Road, 119587 Tags: [friends]`

*Negative test cases*

. The index is invalid (assume there are fewer than 100 contacts in the application) +
_Command:_ +
`edit 100 a/Beijing, China` +
_Result:_ +
`The person index provided is invalid.`

==== View the details of a person

To view the details of an existing contact, we need to use the `select` command.

. First, let's list all the contacts in *BoNUS* +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Then, select the person we want to view (assume there is at least 1 contact in the application) +
_Command:_ +
`select 1` +
_Result:_ +
The person's details will be shown on the right-hand side of the interface.

==== Delete an existing person

To delete an existing contact, we need to use the `delete` command.

. First, let's list all the contacts in *BoNUS* +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Then, delete the first person (assume there is at least 1 contact in the application) +
_Command:_ +
`delete 1` +
_Result:_ +
`Deleted Person: Alex Yeoh Phone: 87438807 Email: alexyeoh@example.com Address: Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40 Tags: [friends]`

==== Add avatar to an existing person

*Positive test case*

To add avatar to a contact, we need to use the `avatar` command.

. First, let's list all the contacts in *BoNUS* +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Then move an image file (`.jpg` or `.png`) into the home folder where you use *BoNUS*. Maybe you want to use the
logo of Java from https://www.hostingireland.ie/images/java-logo.png[here] as a sample.

. Add avatar to the third person in the listing (assume there are at least three contacts) +
_Command:_ +
`avatar 3 java-logo.png`

[NOTE]
====
* Do not move, rename or delete the image you use as an avatar; otherwise, it will not be shown in *BoNUS*.
* You are suggested to move the image into the home folder where you use *BoNUS*.
* Do not be _nasty_ about the input file. If you provide an invalid file that looks like an image but is not an actual image,
the area reserved for avatar will simply become transparent.
====

*Negative test cases*

. Use an invalid index +
_Command:_ +
`avatar -1 java-logo.png` +
_Result:_ +
`Invalid command format!` +
`Index is not a non-zero unsigned integer.`

. Use a non-existing file +
_Command:_ +
`avatar 1 no-java.png` +
_Result:_ +
`Invalid command format!` +
`The provided image path does not exist.`

=== Add/view/edit/delete events

==== Listing of events
. First, let's start by listing all the events in **BoNUS** +
*Positive test case* +
_Command:_ +
`listE` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all events`

You should see that the application automatically switches from contact list to event list after the command listE.

*Negative test case* +

. Incorrect capitalization of command +
_Command:_ +
`ListE` +
_Result:_ +
`Unknown command` +
. Invalid spelling +
_Command:_ +
`listEE` +
_Result:_ +
`Unknown command`

Commands are case sensitive.


==== Adding of events

[NOTE]
====
* The standard format for time should be `DDMMYYYY HH:MM` in 24-hour format.
* However, the application may sometimes be _smart_ enough to interpret what you typed. For example, if you type `this afternoon`
or `tomorrow evening`, it will be automatically converted to the standard format.
* Do NOT try to _challenge_ the application, it is not promised to produce an expected result if you use non-standard format
or if the expression is not simple or clear enough.
* Avoid putting the year first when using the non-standard format.
====

. Let's start by adding an Event called `CS3201 Project Meeting` into **BoNUS**. +
_Command:_ +
`addE n/CS3201 Project Meeting dt/17112017 15:30 a/School Of Computing, SR09, NUS` +
