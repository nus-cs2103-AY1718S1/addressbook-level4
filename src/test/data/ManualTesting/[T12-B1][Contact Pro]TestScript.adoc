== Loading the sample data

Create a folder `data` in the directory where from where the jar file is going to be run. Rename the `SampleData.xml`
file to `addressbook.xml` and copy it to the newly created `data` folder. When you run the application, 20 contacts
will be loaded

== Outline
The test cases are designed so that each category of tests is self contained, meaning that completing one of them
does not influence the outcome of the other tests. If you perform individual tests from a category, it might be in
conflict with the assumptions about the current state of the data.
