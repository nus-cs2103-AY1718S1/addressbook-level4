= Manual Test Script For '[W15-B4][3W]'

== How to load the data files
As our applcation consists of one address book and one task book, and our separate storage of tasks and contacts, we have put the sample address book xml file and task book xml file inside the same folder named `[W15-B4][3W]SampleData`. +

. Create a new empty folder for conducting this manual testing.
. Copy or move the sample data folder into the new folder.
. Put the Jar file into the same folder.

After the above three steps, our app will be able to read and write from the sample data xml files. +

== Layout of the interface
We try to keep the original interface design. The interface layout design is roughly the same as the addressBook level 4 application. +

. The top most is the `menu bar`.
. The `foot bar` is at the bottom.
. The `person panel` is at the left hand side.
. The `map view panel` is in the middle.
. The `task panel` is at the right hand side.
. Type in the command in the command box and execute the command by using `enter` key on the keyboard.

Next, we will start manually testing this application's functionalities by groups.
